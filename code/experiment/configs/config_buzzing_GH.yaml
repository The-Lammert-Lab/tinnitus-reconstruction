# This is a template config file that describes how to customize it.
# It is a fully-functional config file on its own,
# but includes additional comments to help explain what the different
# fields mean. 

# A good syntax for this field is
# {experiment_name}-{target_signal}-{subject_initials}-[resynth]
experiment_name: paper1-buzzing-GH
subject_ID: GH

# These fields describe the number of trials in the experiment.

# n_trial_per_block is the number of trials per block of the experiment.
# A block is a set of contiguous trials without a break a break.
# Subjects get a break between blocks.
# These are both required fields.
n_trials_per_block: 100
n_blocks: 20

# The total trials should be the number of trials per block
# times the number of blocks.
# This is not a required field.
total_trials: 2000

# These "freq" fields describe the frequency range of the stimuli,
# including the minimum frequency and maximum frequency,
# both in Hz.
# The duration field describes the duration
# of the stimului in seconds.
# These are not required fields.
# Default values are set to min_freq = 100 and max_freq = 22000
# and duration = 0.5.
# These defaults are defined in
# tinnitus-project/code/stimulus-generation/@AbstractStimulusGenerationMethod.
min_freq: 100
max_freq: 13000
duration: 0.5

# For a stimulus type that uses bins,
# the number of bins are set here.
# This should be a positive scalar integer.
n_bins: 100

# This required parameter gives the stimuli type.
# The name is the class that defines the stimuli type
# without "StimulusGeneration".
stimuli_type: UniformPrior

# Some stimulus generation methods have other parameters
# associated with them.
# For example, the Gaussian Prior stimulus generation method
# requires an n_bins_filled_mean and n_bins_filled_var property.
# You can see what extra parameters are required for your method
# by inspecting the class definition for the method, 
# e.g., at tinnitus-project/code/stimulus-generation/.
# If you do not overwrite values in the config,
# default values are used, which are described
# in the class definition.
min_bins: 30
max_bins: 30

# For an experiment with a target signal
# (i.e., for pilot subjects)
# this field describes the full filepath
# to the target signal audio file.
target_signal_filepath: /home/alec/code/tinnitus-project/code/experiment/ATA/ATA_Tinnitus_Buzzing_Tone_1sec.wav

# This field gives the short-form name of the target signal.
# For resynth experiments, you should name it
# "resynth-buzzing" for instance.
target_signal_name: buzzing

# This field is a boolean flag
# that indicates whether the target signal
# should be binned (and then unbinned)
# before playback to the user.
bin_target_signal: true

# This is the path where the output files are saved.
# This is not a required field.
# If it is is unset, it will default to
# tinnitus-project/code/experiment/Data.
data_dir: /home/alec/code/tinnitus-project/code/experiment/Data/data-paper

# This field determines in what form the stimuli are saved.
# The available options are 'bins', 'waveform', or 'spectrum'.
# If not set, it will default to 'waveform'.
stimuli_save_type: bins
