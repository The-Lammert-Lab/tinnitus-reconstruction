# ATA Target Sounds

The files within the `tinnitus-project/experiment/ATA` directory are the shortened versions of those presented on the American Tinnitus Association website ([here](https://www.ata.org/listen-sample-tinnitus-sounds)). 
They are representitive of the range of sounds experienced by those with tinnitus and function in this project as the target sound for A-X protocol experiments.
These are used for experimental protocols where the subject is tasked with matching a target stimulus ("A-X" protocols).
