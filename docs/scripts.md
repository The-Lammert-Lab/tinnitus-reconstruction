### hyperparameter_sweep_custom

Hyperparameter Sweep Custom Stimulus

Evaluate hyperparameters of stimulus generation using the 'custom' stimulus paradigm.
Evaluate hyperparameters over different target signals.

This code assumes that each each experiment uses the same number of bins and that the reconstructions should be done over the bin representation.

**OUTPUTS:**

- A figure of reconstructions plotted against the target signal and simulated answers.
