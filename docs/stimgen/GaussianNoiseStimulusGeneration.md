# Gaussian Noise Stimulus Generation 

This is a stimulus generation method in which each tonotopic bin is filled with amplitude chosen from a Gaussian distribution. This class can work with binned representations of the signals. 

-------

### generate_stimulus

Generate a matrix of stimuli
where the matrix is of size nfft x n_trials.
Bins are filled with an amplitude value chosen randomly.
from a Gaussian distribution.
