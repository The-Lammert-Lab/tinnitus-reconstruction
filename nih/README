nih.cls provides a class for grant applications to NIH, the National
Institutes of Health, a US government agency.  

The example-* files provide a template for using nih.cls and submitting
the biographical sketches the NIH wants.  They (potentially) use
denselists.sty, which just reduces list spacing; this is not part of the
class proper.

These files were originally created and are still maintained by Bruce
Donald.  For more information, please see the author's web sites at
http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/brd/NIH/tips and http://www.cs.duke.edu/brd.

All of these files are freely redistributable, see each for details.
(You may freely use, modify and/or distribute this README itself, too.)
