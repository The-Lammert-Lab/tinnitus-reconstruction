\section*{Specific Aims}

The \textbf{objective} of this proposal is to directly and more completely characterize the perceptual experience of tinnitus using the novel application of a primary method for uncovering latent perceptual representations: reverse correlation.
Tinnitus is the perception of ringing, buzzing, or hissing in the ears, which can range from mild and transient to debilitating.
In the U.S. alone, it affects 45 million people per year, 30\% of which report their tinnitus to be moderate to severe.
A primary form of treatment habituation therapy that retrains a patient’s nervous system by habituating it to external sounds that mimic the perceptual experience of the tinnitus sound.
Habituation therapies require accurate estimates of patients’ tinnitus experience in order to promote patient outcomes.
There is a pressing need for new approaches to uncovering individuals’ perceptual experience of tinnitus, because current estimation methods rely on strongly reductionist assumptions concerning the nature of tinnitus sounds, and produce results that are correspondingly biased and incomplete. Reverse correlation holds promise in this regard, as a primary method used to characterize neural tuning that is known to allow for unconstrained and unbiased estimation of latent neural representations (e.g., neural receptive fields [17]), as well as higher-level cognitive representations, including psychophysical kernels that drive the top-down processes of perception (e.g., face or phoneme recognition)[1,5,14,18], and even abstract psychological categories (e.g., “male” vs. “female” faces)[4,10,16], all on the basis of fairly simple stimulus-response data [11,15]. Despite its wide acceptance in other areas of inquiry, reverse correlation has not been brought to bear with respect to uncovering tinnitus experience.

Our \textbf{long-term goal} is to directly uncover and more completely characterize the perceptual experience of tinnitus using the demonstrated capabilities of the reverse correlation approach.
Our guiding hypothesis is that reverse correlation will produce estimates of tinnitus percepts that are substantially more rich, individualized and unbiased than currently possible using existing approaches. The rationale is that high quality characterization of tinnitus percepts can promote detailed assessment of tinnitus, helping to explain individual variability in tinnitus experience, and ultimately informing individualized treatment through enhanced habituation therapies. The proposed work will simultaneously improve the efficiency of the reverse correlation method itself, further enhancing its potential for adoption in clinical settings. We will test our central hypothesis and attain our objective via the following specific aims:

\begin{description}
	\item[Aim \#1: Uncover and reconstruct cognitive representations of tinnitus]{} 
\end{description}

Participants will classify white noise stimuli as sounding like their tinnitus or not.
We will use reverse correlation to infer an unbiased estimate of each participant's cognitive representation of their tinnitus percept. 

\begin{description}
	\item[Aim \#2: Develop efficient reconstruction algorithm for cognitive representations using compressive sensing]{} 
\end{description}

The efficiency of this method can be optimized to require fewer samples using advanced signal processing techniques.
We will develop an open-source compressive sensing data analysis pipeline to acquire convergent cognitive representations using fewer trials.
Our pilot data demonstrates that compressive sensing affords a 90\% decrease in number of trials for equivalent resulant latent representation.
We will also develop and distribute an open-source software implementation the of the reverse correlation method for speech perception,
including the proposed compressive sensing framework, for use by the research community.

\begin{description}
	\item[Aim \#3: Characterize and interpret cognitive representations of tinnitus]{} 
\end{description}

Our compressive sensing framework will allow for rapid data acquisition from participants.
We will characterize cognitive representations of tinnitus between participants and over time.
What is the space of tinnitus cognitive representations?
Are there subtypes or clusters on a lower dimensional manifold?
We will employ dimensionality reduction and clustering algorithms to represent and visualize the data,
providing direct insight into commonalities and variability of tinnitus experience in and between subjects.

\section*{A. Significance}

Tinnitus, the perception of ringing, buzzing, or hissing in the ears when no external sound is present,
is a health condition estimated to affect 10-15\% of adults worldwide \cite{henryTinnitusEpidemiologicPerspective2020}.
The condition is highly heterogeneous and can range from mild and transient to debilitating and constant.
In the U.S., tinnitus affects approximately one in ten Americans, with 7.2\% of those rating their tinnitus as severe (\cite{bhattPrevalenceSeverityExposures2016}.
Tinnitus can be perceived unilaterally or bilaterally and may differ over time, even within individuals.
This heterogeneity in characterization has important implications for research
and clinical practice.
Identifying patterns in how tinnitus sounds and its relationship to hearing may aid in identifying
different forms of tinnitus and revealing their underlying mechanisms.
However, the subjective nature of characterizing tinnitus makes it difficult
to reliably define and measure \cite{vajsakovicPrinciplesMethodsPsychoacoustic2021}.

Current methods to determine cognitive representations of tinnitus
are inefficient and introduce bias, resulting in a lack of standardization in tinnitus assessment \cite{henryTinnitusEpidemiologicPerspective2020}.
Alternate forced-choice (AFC) paradigm tasks ask the patient to determine which of two sounds
is closer to their tinnitus percept
\cite{henryComparisonTwoComputerautomated2001,henryComputerautomatedTinnitusAssessment2004,henryComputerautomatedTinnitusAssessment2013,korthOneStepCloser2020}.
Recent computer and methodological advances have made the test more portable and efficient,
but the AFC paradigm still relies on assumptions about the subject's tinnitus percept.
Tinnitus percepts are too heterogeneous to be represented by pure tones or small-envelope waveforms.
Adequately sampling the psychoacoustic space of possible tinnitus percepts via an AFC task is unfeasible.
Other approaches have attempted to capture the richness of tinnitus percepts using likeness measures,
in which the subject rates whether a presented stimulus is part of their tinnitus percept or not \cite{norenaPsychoacousticCharacterizationTinnitus2002}.
While this method is able to capture more features of cognitive representations of tinnitus,
it is time-consuming and limited by the aural skills of the subject \cite{vajsakovicPrinciplesMethodsPsychoacoustic2021}.
Both these approaches involve the subject comparing an external stimulus to their cognitive representation of the tinnitus percept,
however AFC tasks introduce biases by artificially limiting the stimulus space and likeness measures are time-consuming.
\emph{We believe that a novel reverse correlation-based approach will produce efficient and unbiased cognitive representations of tinnitus percepts}
\cite{gosselinSuperstitiousPerceptionsReveal2003}.

Reverse correlation allows for unconstrained and unbiased
characterization of latent representations directly from stimulus-response data by eliciting responses to
richly varying stimuli, such as white noise (Marmarelis \& Marmarelis, 1978; Nishimoto et al., 2006).
Rich stimuli, by virtue of the fact that they are inherently vague, force the top-down process to exert a clearly
measurable influence on responses. Latent representations that drive the top-down process can then be
estimated by regressing observed responses against the stimuli over many trials (Mineault et al., 2009).
Reverse correlation, as a method, is powerful enough to characterize any aspect of neurological,
cognitive or psychological function that can be modeled as a transductive process (Ringach, 2004). It has
become a primary method used to characterize the latent representations encapsulated in neural tuning
(e.g., receptive fields; Ringach, 2004), and is closely related to the widely-used “white noise approach” to
characterizing physiological (Marmarelis \& Marmarelis, 1978) and engineering (Ljung, 1999) systems. 

Reverse correlation, in addition to its prominence as an important tool relative to lower-level
neural mechanisms, has been increasingly used for inferring higher-level cognitive representations,
including psychophysical kernels that drive the top-down processes of perception (Ahumada \& Lovell,
1971; Gosselin \& Schyns, 2003; Neri \& Levi, 2006; Smith et al., 2012), and even abstract psychological
categories (e.g., “male” vs. “female” faces; Brinkman et al., 2017; Mangini \& Biederman, 2004; Ponsot et
al., 2018). Recent work in vision (e.g., Gosselin \& Schyns, 2003; Liu et al., 2014) has demonstrated that
reverse correlation can effectively characterize cognitive representations underlying letter and face
recognition (Fig 2A). One speech study has also estimated steady-state representations of vowels the /a/
and /i/ using a closely-related paradigm to the one proposed here (Fig 2B; Brimijoin et al., 2013). Our
proposed use of reverse correlation in the domain of speech expands on classic efforts to understand
top-down processing in speech with the presentation of rich, vague stimuli to elicit responses from
listeners (Warren \& Warren, 1970; Vokey \& Read 1985). These studies provide clear evidence that rich
stimuli, such as white noise, are sufficient to engage the top-down process, even if they do not attempt to
characterize the latent representations.

Incomplete characterizations of cognitive representations impoverish our scientific understanding of tinnitus,
weak causal explanations for its etiology, and hinder progress towards effective treatments.
Reverse correlation shows promise to provide a more complete characterization of cognitive representations of tinnitus
and is applicable to other psychophysical domains as well.
Directly characterizing complex representations of tinnitus can enable more effective, targeted treatments,
reveal insights about subtypes of the condition, and pave the way for new tinnitus-masking assistive devices.
Fully characterizing a high-dimensional representation of tinnitus will improve causal explanations
for currently unexplained variability in tinnitus experience both between subjects and within single subjects over time.

\begin{description}
	\item[A.3. Rigor of the Prior Research]{}
\end{description}

\emph{The premise of the proposed work is that reverse correlation will deliver unbiased estimates
of cognitive representations of tinnitus. Furthermore, that compressive sensing will dramatically
increase the efficiency of experiments, resulting in convergent cognitive representations
in a fraction of the samples.}

The evidence for this premise is first based on well-established studies using reverse correlation
to derive cognitive representations of sounds and symbols.
Reverse correlation has been applied to infer cognitive representations from letters
\cite{gosselinSuperstitiousPerceptionsReveal2003}, vowel sounds \cite{brimijoinInternalRepresentationVowel2013},
and faces \cite{brinkmanVisualisingMentalRepresentations2017,smithMeasuringInternalRepresentations2012}.
More broadly, it has been applied to infer the shape of receptive fields
in linear transducers and spiking neurons \cite{ringachReverseCorrelationNeurophysiology2004}.
The reverse correlation paradigm makes minimal assumptions about the derived cognitive representation
since the subject is presented with high-dimensional random input.
A large number of stimulus-response samples are typically required for accurate
reconstruction of cognitive representations using conventional techniques. To address this inefficiency,
studies often limit the richness of stimuli, or impose strict constraints on the reconstructions, leading to
estimates that are biased or incomplete. However, recent advances in signal processing, most notably
a techniques known as compressive sensing, are leading to dramatic improvements the efficiency of
traditional sampling.

We propose to develop an advanced signal processing pipeline that will enable us to overcome
the inefficiencies of existing reverse correlation methods through the use of compressive sensing, a
recent advance in signal processing which has led to dramatic improvements the efficiency of traditional
sampling and signal estimation methods (Baraniuk, 2007). Compressive sensing has recently gained
wide recognition in domains such as medical imaging (Graff \& Sidky, 2015; Lustig et al., 2008), where
considerations of efficiency and bias reduction are critical. Compressive sensing holds promise to
similarly improve the efficiency of reverse correlation, without the drawback of biasing estimates. By
dramatically decreasing the number of trials needed for signal reconstruction, this technique will extend
the range of perceptual mechanisms that can be estimated. Moreover, compressive sensing can be
directly substituted for conventional, regression-based estimation, with no other required changes to
existing experimental protocols. Our ultimate objective is to develop and validate a compressive sensing
data processing pipeline - culminating in an open-source software tool – that will allow for efficient and
accurate reconstruction of latent representations using data obtained via the reverse correlation method.

\section*{B. Innovation}

The proposed project is innovative for several reasons.
First, we will leverage interdisciplinary collaboration between engineering (Lammert)
and hearing science (Ben) to characterize tinnitus to inform clinical care.
Second, we will apply reverse correlation to the tinnitus domain in a novel application,
which promises to deliver unbiased, high-dimensional estimates of cognitive representations of tinnitus.
Third, we will develop a signal processing pipeline to leverage compressive sensing
to acquire accurate estimates of cognitive representations of tinnitus using significantly fewer samples.
This pipeline will save experimenters and subjects time and will enable researchers
to collect data from more subjects and from individual subjects over time.
We will release our open-source software tool online with bindings to popular scientific computing languages.

If consortium/contractual activities represent a significant portion of the overall project, explain why the applicant organization, rather than the ultimate performer of the activities, should be the grantee. The signature of the Authorized Organization Representative on the SF424 (R\&R) cover component (Item 17) signifies that the applicant and all proposed consortium participants understand and agree to the following statement:

\emph{The appropriate programmatic and administrative personnel of each organization involved in this grant application are aware of the agency's consortium agreement policy and are prepared to establish the necessary inter-organizational agreement(s) consistent with that policy.}

\section*{15. Resource Sharing}

NIH considers the sharing of unique research resources developed through NIH-sponsored research an important means to enhance the value and further the advancement of the research. When resources have been developed with NIH funds and the associated research findings published or provided to NIH, it is important that they be made readily available for research purposes to qualified individuals within the scientific community. See Part III, 1.5 Sharing Research Resources.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item{Data Sharing Plan:} Investigators seeking \$500,000 or more in direct costs (exclusive of consortium F\&A) in any year are expected to include a brief 1-paragraph description of how final research data will be shared, or explain why data-sharing is not possible. Specific Funding Opportunity Announcements may require that all applications include this information regardless of the dollar level. Applicants are encouraged to read the specific opportunity carefully and discuss their data-sharing plan with their program contact at the time they negotiate an agreement with the Institute/Center (IC) staff to accept assignment of their application. See Data-Sharing Policy or http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice- files/NOT-OD-03-032.html.
	\item{Sharing Model Organisms:} Regardless of the amount requested, all applications where the development of model organisms is anticipated are expected to include a description of a specific plan for sharing and distributing unique model organisms or state why such sharing is restricted or not possible. See Sharing Model Organisms Policy, and NIH Guide NOT-OD-04-042.
	\item{Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS):} Applicants seeking funding for a genome-wide association study are expected to provide a plan for submission of GWAS data to the NIH-designated GWAS data repository, or an appropriate explanation why submission to the repository is not possible. GWAS is defined as any study of genetic variation across the entire genome that is designed to identify genetic associations with observable traits (such as blood pressure or weight) or the presence or absence of a disease or condition. For further information see Policy for Sharing of Data Obtained in NIH Supported or Conducted Genome-Wide Association Studies, NIH Guide NOT-OD-07-088, and http://grants.nih.gov/grants/gwas/.
