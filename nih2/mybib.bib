  abstract = {Tinnitus is a common problem for millions of individuals and can cause substantial negative effects on their quality of life. A large epidemiologic study of tinnitus and its management patterns in the US adult population is lacking.To quantify the epidemiologic features and effect of tinnitus and to analyze the management of tinnitus in the United States relative to the 2014 American Academy of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) clinical practice guidelines.This cross-sectional analysis of the representative 2007 National Health Interview Survey (raw data, 75 764 respondents) identified a weighted national sample of adults (age, ≥18 years) who reported tinnitus in the preceding 12 months. Data were collected in November 2014 at the University of California, Irvine, and Harvard Medical School.In addition to quantifying prevalence, severity, duration, and regularity of tinnitus, specific data regarding noise exposure and tinnitus management patterns during health care visits were analyzed.Among an estimated (SE) 222.1 (3.4) million US adults, 21.4 (3.4) million (9.6\% [0.3\%]) experienced tinnitus in the past 12 months. Among those who reported tinnitus, 27\% had symptoms for longer than 15 years, and 36\% had nearly constant symptoms. Higher rates of tinnitus were reported in those with consistent exposure to loud noises at work (odds ratio, 3.3; 95\% CI, 2.9-3.7) and during recreational time (odds ratio, 2.6; 95\% CI, 2.3-2.9). Years of work-related noise exposure correlated with increasing prevalence of tinnitus (r\,=\,0.13; 95\% CI, 0.10-0.16). In terms of subjective severity, 7.2\% reported their tinnitus as a big or a very big problem compared with 41.6\% who reported it as a small problem. Only 49.4\% had discussed their tinnitus with a physician, and medications were the most frequently discussed recommendation (45.4\%). Other interventions, such as hearing aids (9.2\%), wearable (2.6\%) and nonwearable (2.3\%) masking devices, and cognitive behavioral therapy (0.2\%), were less frequently discussed.The prevalence of tinnitus in the United States is approximately 1 in 10 adults. Durations of occupational and leisure time noise exposures correlated with rates of tinnitus and are likely targetable risk factors. Management options suggested by the recently published AAO-HNSF guidelines were followed infrequently.},

Reverse correlation is a data-driven method that yields visual proxies of mental representations, based on judgements of randomly varying stimuli. This review is a primer to an influential reverse correlation approach in which stimuli vary by applying random noise to the pixels of images. Our review suggests that the technique is an invaluable tool in the investigation of social perception (e.g., in the perception of race, gender and personality traits), with ample potential applications. However, it is unclear how these visual proxies are best interpreted. Building on advances in cognitive neuroscience, we suggest that these proxies are visual reflections of the internal representations that determine how social stimuli are perceived. In addition, we provide a tutorial on how to perform reverse correlation experiments using R.},

This article surveys the theory of compressive sampling, also known as compressed sensing or CS, a novel sensing/sampling paradigm that goes against the common wisdom in data acquisition. CS theory asserts that one can recover certain signals and images from far fewer samples or measurements than traditional methods use.},

Five SA methods (three of which are purely new) and four measures of input importance (one novel) are presented. Also, the SA approach is adapted to handle discrete variables and to aggregate multiple sensitivity responses. Moreover, several visualizations for the SA results are introduced, such as input pair importance color matrix and variable effect characteristic surface. A wide range of experiments was performed in order to test the SA methods and measures by fitting four well-known models (NN, SVM, RF and decision trees) to synthetic datasets (five regression and five classification tasks). In addition, the visualization capabilities of the SA are demonstrated using four real-world datasets (e.g., bank direct marketing and white wine quality).},

In the present study, we compared the shape of tinnitus tuning curves (TTCs) to psychophysical tuning curves (PTCs), the latter using as a target, an external sound that mimics the tinnitus characteristics. A secondary goal was to compare sound levels required to mask tinnitus to those required to mask tinnitus-mimicking sounds. The TTC, PTC, audiometric thresholds, tinnitus pitch, and level matching results of 32 tinnitus patients were analyzed. Narrowband noise maskers were used for both PTC and TTC procedures. Patients were categorized into three groups based on a combination of individual PTC-TTC results. Our findings indicate that in 41\% of cases, the PTC was sharp (V shape), but the TTC showed a flat configuration, suggesting that the tinnitus-related activity in that subgroup does not behave as a regular stimulus-induced activity. In 30\% of cases, V-shape PTC and TTC were found, indicating that the tinnitus-related activity may share common properties with stimulus-induced activity. For a masker centered at the tinnitus frequency, the tinnitus was more difficult to mask than the mimicking tone in 72\% of patients; this was particularly true for the subset with V-shape PTCs and flat TTCs. These results may have implications for subtyping tinnitus and acoustic therapies, in particular those targeting the tinnitus frequency.},

Although both approaches have enjoyed a certain popularity in the past, their application has been limited to rather low-dimensional and weakly nonlinear systems due to the exponential growth of the number of terms that have to be estimated. We show that Volterra and Wiener series can be represented implicitly as elements of a reproducing kernel Hilbert space by using polynomial kernels. The estimation complexity of the implicit representation is linear in the input dimensionality and independent of the degree of nonlinearity. Experiments show performance advantages in terms of convergence, interpretability, and system sizes that can be handled.},

Both protocols use computer-automation to conduct testing; the protocols differ according to their specific testing algorithms. Twenty subjects with nonfluctuating tinnitus were each tested over two sessions. Results of testing revealed that both protocols could obtain pitch matches within 20 to 25 min. Reliability of responses was good for some subjects but not others, and the Binary protocol generally provided more reliable results.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Psychoacoustic measures of tinnitus typically include loudness and pitch match, minimum masking level (MML), and residual inhibition (RI). We previously developed and documented a computer-automated tinnitus evaluation system (TES) capable of subject-guided loudness and pitch matching. The TES was further developed to conduct computer-aided, subject-guided testing for noise-band matching (NBM), MML, and RI. PURPOSE: The purpose of the present study was to document the capability of the upgraded TES to obtain measures of NBM, MML, and RI, and to determine the test-retest reliability of the responses obtained. RESEARCH DESIGN: Three subject-guided, computer-automated testing protocols were developed to conduct NBM. For MML and RI testing, a 2-12 kHz band of noise was used. All testing was repeated during a second session. STUDY SAMPLE: Subjects meeting study criteria were selected from those who had previously been tested for loudness and pitch matching in our laboratory. A total of 21 subjects completed testing, including seven females and 14 males. RESULTS: The upgraded TES was found to be fairly time efficient. Subjects were generally reliable, both within and between sessions, with respect to the type of stimulus they chose as the best match to their tinnitus. Matching to bandwidth was more variable between measurements, with greater consistency seen for subjects reporting tonal tinnitus or wide-band noisy tinnitus than intermediate types. Between-session repeated MMLs were within 10 dB of each other for all but three of the subjects. Subjects who experienced RI during Session 1 tended to be those who experienced it during Session 2. CONCLUSIONS: This study may represent the first time that NBM, MML, and RI audiometric testing results have been obtained entirely through a self-contained, computer-automated system designed specifically for use in the clinic. Future plans include refinements to achieve greater testing efficiency.},

  abstract = {Chronic tinnitus is the persistent sensation of hearing a sound that exists only inside the head. The prevalence of tinnitus in adults in the United States is estimated at 10 to 15\%. For about 20\% of these individuals the tinnitus is significantly bothersome. Although myriad therapies for tinnitus are offered (often at significant cost), most are not evidence based. Difficulty in the assessment and further development of interventions for tinnitus stems from the limitations of techniques used to evaluate these interventions. Questionnaires are widely available to “measure” (tinnitus can only be indirectly measured) functional effects of tinnitus, such as difficulty sleeping and concentrating, and negative emotions such as anxiety, depression, and annoyance. Questionnaires have recently been documented for sensitivity to change in response to intervention (i.e., “responsiveness”). All of these questionnaires function well to assess the overall impact of tinnitus. The limitations mentioned pertain primarily to measures of tinnitus perception, which typically include the psychoacoustic measures of tinnitus loudness and pitch matches, tinnitus spectral content, minimum masking levels, and residual inhibition. These measures, which are obtained routinely in many clinics and as part of research studies, have not been validated for being diagnostic, prognostic, discriminative, or responsive. In order for these measures to become clinically meaningful, normative standards are needed, both for baseline measures and for repeated measures of tinnitus perception. Evidence-based intervention for tinnitus requires accurately measuring both the perception of, and reactions to, tinnitus.},

  abstract = {Purpose In the past decade, resting-state functional connectivity, acquired using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), has emerged as a popular measure of tinnitus, especially as related to self-reported handicap or psychological reaction. The goal of this study was to assess replicability of neural correlates of tinnitus, namely, resting-state functional connectivity, in the same individuals acquired over 2 sessions. Method Data were collected at 2 different sites (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and Joint Base San Antonio Wilford Hall Ambulatory Surgical Center) using similar 3T magnets and similar data acquisition paradigms. Thirty-six patients (all civilians) were scanned using resting-state fMRI at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Ten patients, active-duty Service members and Veterans, were scanned at the Wilford Hall Ambulatory Surgical Center and the Department of Defense Hearing Center of Excellence. Each participant was scanned twice, a week apart, using identical protocols of 10 min resting-state fMRI. Results Tinnitus handicap scores using the Tinnitus Functional Index and the Tinnitus Primary Function Questionnaire ranged between no or mild handicap to moderately severe handicap but did not significantly differ between visits. We examined the default mode, dorsal attention, and auditory resting-state networks and found that the strength of the within-network functional connections across visit was similar for the attention and default mode networks but not for the auditory network. In addition, the functional connection between the attention network and precuneus, a region of the default mode network, was also replicable across visits. Conclusions Our results show that resting-state fMRI measures are replicable and reliable in patients with a subjective condition, although some networks and functional connections may be more stable than others. This paves the way for using resting-state fMRI to measure the efficacy of tinnitus interventions and as a tool to help propose better management options.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The determination of the tinnitus pitch-match (PM) frequency is not straightforward but an important audiological assessment recommended for clinical and research purposes. We evaluated repetitive recursive matching using an iPod-based matching procedure as a method to estimate a patient's PM frequency without audiometric equipment. METHODS: One hundred and seventeen patients with chronic tonal tinnitus (uni- and bilateral tinnitus) measured their tinnitus in 10 sessions using a self-administered automated iPod-based procedure comprising a recursive 2 interval forced-choice test. RESULTS: Mean SD of the PM frequency of all participants across sessions was 0.41 octaves. The internal consistency measured by Cronbach's α was very high (0.8-{$>$}0.95). As an example, 7 PMs obtained excellent internal consistency (α = 0.93). The exclusion of the first and/or second session led to more definite PMs with a decreased SD. Outliers were identified by PMs departing 2 SDs (i.e., 0.94 octaves) from the mean variability (n = 5). CONCLUSION: Repetitive recursive matching together with recommendations for the exclusion of initial and redundant sessions as well as outlier identification and treatment can enable a reliable estimation of the PM frequency.},

  abstract = {As predictive models increasingly assist human experts (e.g., doctors) in day-to-day decision making, it is crucial for experts to be able to explore and understand how such models behave in different feature subspaces in order to know if and when to trust them. To this end, we propose Model Understanding through Subspace Explanations (MUSE), a novel model agnostic framework which facilitates understanding of a given black box model by explaining how it behaves in subspaces characterized by certain features of interest. Our framework provides end users (e.g., doctors) with the flexibility of customizing the model explanations by allowing them to input the features of interest. The construction of explanations is guided by a novel objective function that we propose to simultaneously optimize for fidelity to the original model, unambiguity and interpretability of the explanation. More specifically, our objective allows us to learn, with optimality guarantees, a small number of compact decision sets each of which captures the behavior of a given black box model in unambiguous, well-defined regions of the feature space. Experimental evaluation with real-world datasets and user studies demonstrate that our approach can generate customizable, highly compact, easy-to-understand, yet accurate explanations of various kinds of predictive models compared to state-of-the-art baselines.},

  abstract = {IntroductionEarly in the study of the dynamics of a physiological system the bioscientist is faced with the task of recognizing the domains of linearity and of nonlinearity of the stimulus-response transformation that the system performs and how these domains compare with the dominant natural variation of the stimuli in the system’s environment. As we saw in the previous chapter, the analytical advantages of linear systems are many, and, therefore, they justify the search for a linear domain in the system’s operational range (if such exists). However, the bioscientist must resist the temptation of being carried away by a natural desire for beautiful and explicit solutions since they often tend to be unrealistic idealizations. We cannot but bow to the evidence that nonlinear system characteristics are abundant in nature and go far beyond the trite admission that every physical system is in some way nonlinear. In much the same way that nonlinearities optimize the design of artificial systems, nonlinearities seem to be necessary for the optimal functioning of physiological systems from the behavioral point of view. There are many such examples: the logarithmic transformation of sensory input in order to accommodate large stimulus ranges, dynamic asymmetries arising from such physiological necessities as sensing direction, and many others.Faced, therefore, with nonlinear physiological systems, for which the principle of superposition does not hold, the question naturally arises as to which types of test stimuli should be applied, so that from the resulting responses the bioscientist is able to deduce (or learn as much as possible about) the functional relationship between the stimulus and response of the system. The application of sinusoidal stimuli is certainly unpromising since the response of the system to two such stimuli of different frequencies is different, in general, from the sum of the responses due to each stimulus separately—so no additional information is gained besides the sinusoidal behavior. In general, the same will hold true for other types of stimulus such as steps, pulses, etc. Figure 4.1 illustrates the situation. If a pulse stimulus is applied, we learn the response of the system to this pulse and have little notion of the response of the system to any other type of stimulus. If the stimulus consists of two triangular pulses as shown in the figure, then we know the response of the system to these two triangular pulses and little else. The same applies for any other specific waveform, such as the one shown in part C of the same figure. Therefore, faced with a nonlinear system it appears that we can do nothing less than test it with a great variety of stimuli and catalog the responses to them. This is exactly what a white-noise stimulus accomplishes in an efficient manner.},

  abstract = {Objectives New tinnitus therapies are being developed and marketed that target the patient’s tinnitus frequency. This frequency is estimated clinically by pitch matching, which has the patient identify the pure tone that is closest to the perceived tinnitus frequency. Though widely used, pitch matching is heavily criticized as unreliable, and the degree of reliability varies among patients. At the very least, it is recommended that multiple pitch matches be used to identify the patient’s tinnitus frequency. Even so, it is not clear how many pitch matches to collect, how they should be combined, or how doing so will enhance the audiologist’s certainty about the true tinnitus frequency. In this article, we describe a simple Bayesian method of sequentially combining pitch matches until acceptable precision is achieved and illustrate the method in 10 patients with chronic tinnitus. Design Subjects were recruited from previous study participants and support group attendees at the National Center for Rehabilitative Auditory Research. Thirty tinnitus pitch matches were elicited from 10 patients with chronic, monotonal tinnitus. Results A Bayesian sequential analysis yielded estimated tinnitus frequencies for 7 patients that were within one-quarter octave of their true value with 90\% certainty. Between four and twenty pitch matches were required to achieve acceptable results in these seven patients. Conclusions Despite criticism, pitch matching is widely used to estimate tinnitus frequency. We address reliability concerns with a Bayesian sequential analysis to jointly estimate tinnitus frequency and reliability. The method is easily applied.},

  abstract = {We can better understand deep neural networks by identifying which features each of their neurons have learned to detect. To do so, researchers have created Deep Visualization techniques including activation maximization, which synthetically generates inputs (e.g. images) that maximally activate each neuron. A limitation of current techniques is that they assume each neuron detects only one type of feature, but we know that neurons can be multifaceted, in that they fire in response to many different types of features: for example, a grocery store class neuron must activate either for rows of produce or for a storefront. Previous activation maximization techniques constructed images without regard for the multiple different facets of a neuron, creating inappropriate mixes of colors, parts of objects, scales, orientations, etc. Here, we introduce an algorithm that explicitly uncovers the multiple facets of each neuron by producing a synthetic visualization of each of the types of images that activate a neuron. We also introduce regularization methods that produce state-of-the-art results in terms of the interpretability of images obtained by activation maximization. By separately synthesizing each type of image a neuron fires in response to, the visualizations have more appropriate colors and coherent global structure. Multifaceted feature visualization thus provides a clearer and more comprehensive description of the role of each neuron.},

The method is based on spectral analyses in a two-dimensional spatial frequency domain for spatially localized areas within and around their receptive fields. Extracellular single-unit recordings were performed for area 17 and 18 neurons in anesthetized cats. A dynamic dense noise pattern was presented in which the pattern covered an area two to three times larger than the classical receptive field. Spike trains were then cross-correlated with frequency spectra of localized noise pattern to obtain spatially localized selectivity maps in the two-dimensional frequency domain. Our findings are as follows. (1) The new LSRC method allows measurements of two-dimensional frequency tunings and their spatial extent even for cells with substantial nonlinearity. (2) A small subset of neurons shows spatial inhomogeneity in the two-dimensional frequency tunings. (3) In addition to facilitatory response profiles, we can also visualize suppressive profiles localized both in space and spatial frequency domains. Our results suggest that the new analysis technique can be a powerful tool for measuring visual response profiles that contain inhomogeneity in space, as well as for studying neurons with substantial nonlinearities. These features make the method particularly suitable for studying response profiles of neurons in early as well as intermediate extrastriate visual areas.},

Ten subjects with chronic tinnitus were asked to rate on a numeric scale the contribution of elementary pitch sensations evoked by isolated frequency components to their overall tinnitus sensation. The resulting 'internal tinnitus spectra', which represented the estimated perceptual contribution to the tinnitus sensation as a function of frequency over a large range of frequencies, were found to occupy a wide frequency range corresponding largely to that at which hearing thresholds were abnormally elevated. In most cases, they exhibited a broad peak falling within the hearing loss range. This pattern of result suggests that in subjects with high-frequency hearing loss, tinnitus sensations, when present, resemble those evoked by high-frequency noise bands with, in some cases, a superimposed tonal-like pitch. These results confirm and extend earlier results in the literature and agree with the patients' reports; their practical implications for the design of future studies on tinnitus and theoretical implications for the understanding of the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying tinnitus are discussed. The results of an additional experiment showed that the internal tinnitus spectrum could be altered by perceptual training in a fine frequency discrimination task with tones in the frequency range of the main peak of the tinnitus spectrum.}

  abstract = {Compressive sensing has emerged as an area that opens new perspectives in signal acquisition and processing. It appears as an alternative to the traditional sampling theory, endeavoring to reduce the required number of samples for successful signal reconstruction. In practice, compressive sensing aims to provide saving in sensing resources, transmission, and storage capacities and to facilitate signal processing in the circumstances when certain data are unavailable. To that end, compressive sensing relies on the mathematical algorithms solving the problem of data reconstruction from a greatly reduced number of measurements by exploring the properties of sparsity and incoherence. Therefore, this concept includes the optimization procedures aiming to provide the sparsest solution in a suitable representation domain. This work, therefore, offers a survey of the compressive sensing idea and prerequisites, together with the commonly used reconstruction methods. Moreover, the compressive sensing problem formulation is considered in signal processing applications assuming some of the commonly used transformation domains, namely, the Fourier transform domain, the polynomial Fourier transform domain, Hermite transform domain, and combined time-frequency domain.},

  abstract = {The study of internal knowledge representations is a cornerstone of the research agenda in the interdisciplinary study of~cognition. An influential proposal assumes that the brain~uses its internal knowledge of the external world to constrain, in a top-down manner, high-dimensional sensory data into a lower-dimensional representation that enables perceptual decisions and other higher-level cognitive functions [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. This proposal relies on a precise formulation of~the observer-specific internal knowledge (i.e., the internal representations, or models) that guides reduction of the high-dimensional retinal input onto a low-dimensional code. Here, we directly revealed the content of subjective internal representations by instructing five observers to detect~a face in the presence of only white noise, to force a pure top-down, knowledge-based task. We used reverse correlation methods to visualize each observer's internal representation that supports detection of an illusory face. Using reverse correlation again, this time applied to observers' electroencephalogram activity, we established where and when in the brain specific internal knowledge conceptually interprets the input white noise as a face. We show that internal representations can be reconstructed experimentally from behavioral and brain data, and that their content drives neural activity first over frontal and then over occipitotemporal cortex.},

  abstract = {Speech processing relies on interactions between auditory and motor systems and is asymmetrically organized in the human brain. The left auditory system is specialized for processing of phonemes, whereas the right is specialized for processing of pitch changes in speech affecting prosody. In speakers of tonal languages, however, processing of pitch (i.e., tone) changes that alter word meaning is left-lateralized indicating that linguistic function and language experience shape speech processing asymmetries. Here, we investigated the asymmetry of motor contributions to auditory speech processing in male and female speakers of tonal and non-tonal languages. We temporarily disrupted the right or left speech motor cortex using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and measured the impact of these disruptions on auditory discrimination (mismatch negativity; MMN) responses to phoneme and tone changes in sequences of syllables using electroencephalography (EEG). We found that the effect of motor disruptions on processing of tone changes differed between language groups: disruption of the right speech motor cortex suppressed responses to tone changes in non-tonal language speakers, whereas disruption of the left speech motor cortex suppressed responses to tone changes in tonal language speakers. In non-tonal language speakers, the effects of disruption of left speech motor cortex on responses to tone changes were inconclusive. For phoneme changes, disruption of left but not right speech motor cortex suppressed responses in both language groups. We conclude that the contributions of the right and left speech motor cortex to auditory speech processing are determined by the functional roles of acoustic cues in the listener's native language. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The principles underlying hemispheric asymmetries of auditory speech processing remain debated. The asymmetry of processing of speech sounds is affected by low-level acoustic cues, but also by their linguistic function. By combining transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalography (EEG), we investigated the asymmetry of motor contributions to auditory speech processing in tonal and non-tonal language speakers. We provide causal evidence that the functional role of the acoustic cues in the listener's native language affects the asymmetry of motor influences on auditory speech discrimination ability [indexed by mismatch negativity (MMN) responses]. Lateralized top-down motor influences can affect asymmetry of speech processing in the auditory system.},

  abstract = {Selection of an efficient model parametrization (model order, delay, etc.) has crucial importance in parametric system identification. It navigates a trade-off between representation capabilities of the model (structural bias) and effects of over-parametrization (variance increase of the estimates). There exists many approaches to this widely studied problem in terms of statistical regularization methods and information criteria. In this paper, an alternative ℓ1 regularization scheme is proposed for estimation of sparse linear-regression models based on recent results in compressive sensing. It is shown that the proposed scheme provides consistent estimation of sparse models in terms of the so-called oracle property, it is computationally attractive for large-scale over-parameterized models and it is applicable in case of small data sets, i.e., underdetermined estimation problems. The performance of the approach w.r.t. other regularization schemes is demonstrated in an extensive Monte Carlo study.},

As a powerful learning tool, increasingly neural networks have been adopted by many large-scale information processing applications but there is no a set of well defined criteria for choosing a neural network. The user mostly treats a neural network as a black box and cannot explain how learning from input data was done nor how performance can be consistently ensured. We have experimented with several information visualization designs aiming to open the black box to possibly uncover underlying dependencies between the input data and the output data of a neural network. In this paper, we present our designs and show that the visualizations not only help us design more efficient neural networks, but also assist us in the process of using neural networks for problem solving such as performing a classification task.},

  abstract = {Tinnitus, the perception of sound in the absence of a physical sound in the environment, is highly heterogeneous. It varies in its etiology, characteristics, and impact on an individual's life. The sound is commonly described as "ringing," "buzzing," "crickets," "hissing," "humming." Tinnitus can be acute or chronic, mild or disabling. It can be perceived unilaterally or, more commonly, bilaterally. The sound and its location differ from person to person and fluctuate in the same individual over a certain period of time. This heterogeneity in characterization has important implications for research and clinical practice. Identifying patterns in how tinnitus sounds and its relationship to hearing may aid in identifying different forms of tinnitus and revealing their underlying mechanisms. However, the subjective nature of characterizing tinnitus makes it difficult to reliably define and measure. This chapter will focus on reviewing the psychoacoustic assessment of tinnitus, its relationship to cognitive and behavioral aspects of tinnitus, and its neuropathophysiology. In particular, it will describe the heterogeneity of tinnitus and tinnitus matching, and how individual variability in measures may be used to guide treatment and as a prognostic factor.},

  abstract = {The ability to track depression severity over time using passive sensing of speech would enable frequent and inexpensive monitoring, allowing rapid assessment of treatment efficacy as well as improved long term care of individuals at high risk for depression. In this paper an algorithm is proposed that estimates the articulatory coordination of speech from audio and video signals, and uses these coordination features to learn a prediction model to track depression severity with treatment. In addition, the algorithm is able to adapt its prediction model to an individual’s baseline data in order to improve tracking accuracy. The algorithm is evaluated on two data sets. The first is the Wyss Institute Biomarkers for Depression (WIBD) multi-modal data set, which includes audio and video speech recordings. The second data set was collected by Mundt et al (2007) and contains audio speech recordings only. The data sets are comprised of patients undergoing treatment for depression as well as control subjects. In its within-subject tracking of clinical Hamilton depression (HAM-D) ratings, the algorithm achieves root mean squared error (RMSE) of 5.49 with Spearman correlation of r = 0.63 on the WIBD data set, and achieves RMSE = 5.99 with r = 0.48 on the Mundt data set.},

  abstract = {Recent years have produced great advances in training large, deep neural networks (DNNs), including notable successes in training convolutional neural networks (convnets) to recognize natural images. However, our understanding of how these models work, especially what computations they perform at intermediate layers, has lagged behind. Progress in the field will be further accelerated by the development of better tools for visualizing and interpreting neural nets. We introduce two such tools here. The first is a tool that visualizes the activations produced on each layer of a trained convnet as it processes an image or video (e.g. a live webcam stream). We have found that looking at live activations that change in response to user input helps build valuable intuitions about how convnets work. The second tool enables visualizing features at each layer of a DNN via regularized optimization in image space. Because previous versions of this idea produced less recognizable images, here we introduce several new regularization methods that combine to produce qualitatively clearer, more interpretable visualizations. Both tools are open source and work on a pre-trained convnet with minimal setup.},

  abstract = {This work is concerned with identification of Wiener systems whose outputs are measured by binary-valued sensors. The system consists of a linear FIR (finite impulse response) subsystem of known order, followed by a nonlinear function with a known parametrization structure. The parameters of both linear and nonlinear parts are unknown. Input design, identification algorithms, and their essential properties are presented under the assumptions that the distribution function of the noise is known and the nonlinearity is continuous and invertible. It is shown that under scaled periodic inputs, identification of Wiener systems can be decomposed into a finite number of core identification problems. The concept of joint identifiability of the core problem is introduced to capture the essential conditions under which the Wiener system can be identified with binary-valued observations. Under scaled full-rank conditions and joint identifiability, a strongly convergent algorithm is constructed. The algorithm is shown to be asymptotically efficient for the core identification problem, hence achieving asymptotic optimality in its convergence rate. For computational simplicity, recursive algorithms are also developed.},
