\section{Facilities, Equipments, \& other Resources}
This section of the proposal is used to assess the adequacy of the resources available to perform the effortproposed to satisfy both the Intellectual Merit and Broader Impacts review criteria. Proposers should describeonly those resources that are directly applicable. Proposers should include an aggregated description of theinternal and external resources (both physical and personnel) that the organization and its collaborators willprovide to the project, should it be funded. Such information must be provided in this section, in lieu of otherparts of the proposal (e.g., budget justification, project description). The description should be narrative in natureand must not include any quantifiable financial information. Reviewers will evaluate the information during themerit review process and the cognizant NSF Program Officer will review it for programmatic and technicalsufficiency.
