% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  \usepackage{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  \graphicspath{{gfx}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png,.eps}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.

\section{Introduction}

\IEEEPARstart{T}{innitus}\textemdash{}the perception of sound (\eg ringing, buzzing)
in the absence of an external stimulus\textemdash{}affects over 50 million people in the U.S.,
a third of which experience functional cognitive impairment and substantial reduction
in quality of life \cite{henryTinnitusEpidemiologicPerspective2020,vajsakovicPrinciplesMethodsPsychoacoustic2021}.
Primary treatment options for tinnitus are currently limited by a lack of methods
for accurately characterizing the internal sounds experienced by patients.
Tinnitus treatment typically involves \textit{sound therapy}, a form of habituation therapy,
which involves target exposure to external sounds to attenuate the perception of tinnitus
or to encourage patients to perceive their tinnitus as a neutral stimulus
\cite{jastreboff25YearsTinnitus2015}.
Critically, treatment outcomes have been repeatedly shown to improve
when the external sounds used in sound therapy are closely informed
by the internal tinnitus experience of the patient
\cite{steinInhibitioninducedPlasticityTinnitus2015,tassCounteractingTinnitusAcoustic2012,okamotoListeningTailormadeNotched2010,davisNeuromonicsTinnitusTreatment2007},
specifically, its component frequencies that constitute
the \textit{psychoacoustic tinnitus spectrum} (PTS).
However, existing methods for characterizing the PTS rely on reductionist assumptions
concerning the nature of tinnitus sounds (\eg that they are pure tones or have small-width Gaussian spectra)
and produce characterizations that are correspondingly bias and incomplete
when compared to the spectral variety of tinnitus percepts\textemdash{}less than
50\% of tinnitus patients
report their tinnitus sounding like ``ringing'' \cite{vajsakovicPrinciplesMethodsPsychoacoustic2021}.
There is a pressing need for methods to more completely characterize the PTS
\cite{henryTinnitusEpidemiologicPerspective2020,henryMeasurementTinnitus2016,norenaPsychoacousticCharacterizationTinnitus2002},
to further improve treatment outcomes for patients suffering from tinnitus.

We utilize \textit{reverse correlation} approach to characterize the PTS more completely,
without the strong biases introduced by existing methods.
Reverse correlation is a widely-accepted method for unconstrained and unbiased estimation
of latent neural representations (\eg neural receptive fields)
based on the white-noise method for black-box system identification
\cite{ringachReverseCorrelationNeurophysiology2004,ljungMeasureLackFit1978}.
This method has been used to characterize the psychophysical processes of perception
in vision (\eg faces) and audition (\eg phonemes)
\cite{ahumadaStimulusFeaturesSignal1971,gosselinSuperstitiousPerceptionsReveal2003,brimijoinInternalRepresentationVowel2013}
all on the basis of stimulus-response data
\cite{marmarelisWhiteNoiseMethodSystem1978,neriReceptivePerceptiveFields2006}.
In reverse correlation, subjects are presented with richly-varying random stimuli (\eg white noise)
and make simple ``yes/no'' responses about whether they perceive a particular signal
(\eg their tinnitus percept).
Internal representations, such as the PTS, can be estimated
by regressing subject responses against the stimuli over many trials.
Despite widespread use in characterizing neural and cognitive representations,
reverse correlation has never been used for tinnitus characterization.
One limitation of reverse correlation is the sheer number of trials
required to recover a good signal reconstruction.
Classically, reverse correlation has required a large number of stimulus-response trials
to yield accurate results (\eg 20,000 trials in \cite{gosselinSuperstitiousPerceptionsReveal2003}),
a property that makes reverse correlation time-consuming in a clinical setting.

We overcome this limitation of reverse correlation using \textit{compressed sensing} (CS)
to reconstruct the PTS with high fidelity using far fewer trials.
Compressive sensing can reduce the number of trials
required an order of magnitude compared to conventional estimation, thereby allowing for efficient and
accurate characterization of tinnitus within a single clinical visit. Compressive sensing has gained broad
recognition in medical imaging \hl{[CITE]}, due to its ability to reduce scan times without sacrificing image quality or
introducing bias, and its promise for similarly improving reverse correlation has been recently demonstrated by
our group \textit{in-silico} \hl{[CITE]}.

Our long-term goal is to improve outcomes for patients suffering from tinnitus by providing a validated
clinical assay, based on the demonstrated capabilities of the reverse correlation approach, that clinicians can
use to accurately and efficiently characterize the individualized perceptual experience of tinnitus. Our guiding
hypothesis is that reverse correlation will produce PTS estimates that patients will consistently report as being
similar to their own tinnitus experience. The rationale for this work is that accurate and efficient characterization
of the PTS can inform individualized tinnitus treatment with enhanced habituation therapies.

% document is a Latex  template for Technology Letters to be submitted to IEEE OJEMB \cite{ahumadaStimulusFeaturesSignal1971}. Submissions must have the sections listed in the following exactly in the order shown here: Introduction, Materials and Methods, Results, Discussion, Conclusions. Manuscripts to be submitted to IEEE OJEMB as a Science Letters must use a different template. For both types of manuscript, the authors can opt to add a Supplementary Materials section.

% The very first letter is a 2 line initial drop letter followed
% by the rest of the first word in caps.
% 
% form to use if the first word consists of a single letter:
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{demo} file is ....
% 
% form to use if you need the single drop letter followed by
% normal text (unknown if ever used by the IEEE):
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{}demo file is ....
% 
% Some journals put the first two words in caps:
% \IEEEPARstart{T}{his demo} file is ....
% 
% Here we have the typical use of a "T" for an initial drop letter
% and "HIS" in caps to complete the first word.
% You must have at least 2 lines in the paragraph with the drop letter

\subsection{Stimulus Generation}

To generate stimuli, we partition the frequency space $f \in [100,~13,000]$ Hz
into 100 mel-spaced frequency bins
so that each bin is perceptually different to a listener \cite{polfremanSoundSpottingFrameBased2001}.
For each stimulus, we randomly select $30$ bins
with equal probability to be ``filled'' with power $0$ dB.
Unfilled bins are set to $-20$ dB.
The inverse Fourier transform of the spectrum yields a $500$-ms stimulus waveform.

Before arriving at this method, we ran an \textit{in-silico} hyperparameter sweep over
nine stimulus generation methods and hundreds of hyperparameter values
(\cf Supplementary Information).

\subsection{Theory}

A subject performing $n$ trials with $b$ frequency bins produces
a stimulus matrix $\Psi \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times b}$
and a response column vector $y \in {1,-1}^n$,
where $1$ corresponds to a ``yes'' response and $-1$ to a ``no.''
We assume that the PTS, $x \in \mathbb{R}^b$, is sparse in some basis $\Phi \in \mathbb{R}^{b \times b}$
(\cf Supplementary Information).

\subsubsection{Linear Regression}

The linear regression solution is given by
the normalized inner product of the stimulus matrix
and the responses (Eq. \ref{eq:linreg}).
Intuitively, this implies that the reconstruction, $x$,
is a linear combination of the randomly-generated stimuli
that lies closer in simularity to the ``yes'' stimuli than the ``no'' ones
\cite{gosselinSuperstitiousPerceptionsReveal2003}.

\begin{equation}
  \hat{x} = \frac{1}{n} \Phi y
  \label{eq:linreg}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Compressed Sensing}

The one-bit compressed sensing reconstruction problem is:

\begin{equation}
	y = \mathrm{sgn}(\Psi \Phi x)
\end{equation}

which is an underdetermined system with infinite solutions.
Compressed sensing says that when $\Theta = \Psi \Phi$
is sufficiently well-behaved
(\eg satisfies the restricted isometry property,
which Gaussian and Bernoulli random matrices do with high probability,
\cf \cite{candesIntroductionCompressiveSampling2008})
that the sparsest solution $\hat{x}$ can be found by optimizing the $l_1$ norm of $\hat{x}$.
We solve the optimization problem originally described by \cite{zhangEfficientAlgorithmsRobust2014}:

\begin{equation}
	\hat{x} = \min_{||x||_2 \leq 1} - \frac{1}{n} (\Theta x)^{\mathrm{T}} y + \lambda ||x||_1
  \label{eq:cs}
\end{equation}

with tunable scalar parameter $\lambda$.

\subsection{Experiment}

We recruited $N=2$ subjects for the experiment
with healthy hearing from $[100,~13,000]$ Hz.
Subjects used Sennheiser PXC 550 over-the-ear headphones
and manually adjusted loudness
using sample stimuli before performing the task
(Sennheiser GmbH \& Co. KG, Wedemark, Germany).

The subjects performed an AX paradigm binary choice task
in $20$ blocks of $100$ with breaks between blocks,
for a total of $2,000$ trials per experimental condition.
For each trial in the experiment,
the subject listened to an auditory target signal
followed by one of the randomly generated stimuli.
The subject was instructed to press the J key if the stimulus sounded similar to the target signal
and the F key if the stimulus did not (Fig. \ref{fig:experimentdiagram}).

The target signals were drawn from online examples
from the American Tinnitus Association,
representing the range of tinnitus experiences
(American Tinnitus Association, Vienna, Virginia).
We selected two example tinnitus waveforms from their website: ``buzzing'' and ``roaring''.
In this way, the AX experiment mimicked
comparing a randomly-generated stimulus to an internal perception of tinnitus,
however the known target signals
unify across subjects and provide a gold-standard to benchmark against.

\section{Results}

Subjects performed an AX-paradigm reverse correlation experiment
using ATA tinnitus examples as the target sounds.
We reconstructed the PTS using the responses and stimuli from the experiments
using both the $L_2$ linear regression and compressed sensing reconstruction algorithms.
Figure \ref{fig:reconstructions} shows the tonotopic bin representation
of the reconstructions compared to the ground-truth target representation.

\subsection*{\hl{Notes}}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Ben is way better at the experiment than Nelson. Sorry, Nelson.
  \item CS results are consistently better than LR.
  Since this result doesn't necessarily hold for the synthetic experiment,
  it implies that CS' main contribution is \textit{denoising}
  by countering human error \cite{planRobust1bitCompressed2012, zhangEfficientAlgorithmsRobust2014}.
  \item Is Pearson's $r$ really the best way to measure accuracy?
  If you miss the big hump in either, I kind of think that we've failed.
  So maybe KL divergence, but then we have to normalize each spectrum
  to make probability distributions.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Conclusion}

We applied reverse correlation to the novel domain of psychoacoustic tinnitus spectrum reconstruction
and improved reconstruction performance (PTS) up to 2x using compressed sensing.
Using our reconstruction algorithm, the experiment required only 2,000 trials
for quality reconstruction results which is a 10x improvement over reverse correlation results in similar domains
\cite{gosselinSuperstitiousPerceptionsReveal2003}.
Subjects finished the experiment within two hours,
indicating that this procedure is feasible as an ``outpatient medical test''
to characterize the PTS of a subject,
a crucial step in diagnosis and treatment \cite{henryTinnitusEpidemiologicPerspective2020,henryMeasurementTinnitus2016,norenaPsychoacousticCharacterizationTinnitus2002}.
After fine-tuning, we will use this algorithm
to characterize the PTSes of clinical tinnitus patients
to help in the treatment of patients and to further understanding of tinnitus.

Results from human subjects are far below the synthetic baseline,
indicating that some improvements can be made to boost human performance.
The simplicity of the mathematical model for the synthetic subject
(and its favorability towards the problem)
leads to a synthetic subject that accounts for each tonotopic bin
with equal attentiveness, does not suffer fatigue, and never changes its
threshold for positive vs. negative responses.
The experiment asks subjects to rate each stimulus as 
similar or dissimilar to the target tinnitus signal.
This can lead to ``threshold drift,''
where the decision threshold between positive and negative assignments to stimuli
change as the experiment goes along.
While the AX paradigm protects against this effect somewhat
by playing the target sound before each decision stimulus,
subjects self-reported feeling unsure that they were making consistent decisions.
In future investigations,
we will use a two alternate forced choice (2AFC) paradigm,
where a subject is provided two stimuli after the cue,
and chooses the more similar one.
All chosen stimuli get positive responses assigned
and non-chosen stimuli get negative responses assigned (\hl{CITE?}).
Reconstructions can proceed normally, using both the positive and negative responses.

% \section{Editorial Policy}
% {
% 	Do not publish “preliminary” data or results. The submitting author is responsible for obtaining agreement of all coauthors and any consent required from sponsors before submitting a paper. IEEE OJEMB strongly discourages courtesy authorship. It is the obligation of the authors to cite relevant prior work. IEEE OJEMB expects the main source of references be archival journal articles or books or thesis. Conference proceeding papers should be minimized since many are not undergoing rigorous peer reviews. 
% 	At least two reviews are required for every paper submitted. Indecipherable English is a valid reason for rejection. There is a service available that will help you improve your English for a fee, and the link to that service can be found at \textit{http://www.ieee.org/web/publications/authors/transjnl/ index.html}. 
	
% }

% \section{Publication Principles}
% {
% 	The two types of contents of that are published are; 1) peer-reviewed and 2) archival. IEEE OJEMB publishes scholarly articles of archival value as well as tutorial expositions and critical reviews of classical subjects and topics of current interest. 
% 	Authors should consider the following points:
% 	\begin{enumerate}
% 		\item Technical papers submitted for publication must advance the state of knowledge and must cite relevant prior work. 
% 		\item The length of a submitted paper should be commensurate with the importance, or appropriate to the complexity, of the work. 
% 		\item Authors must convince both peer reviewers and the editors of the scientific and technical merit of a paper; the standards of proof are higher when extraordinary or unexpected results are reported. 
% 		\item Because replication is required for scientific progress, papers submitted for publication must provide sufficient information to allow readers to perform similar experiments or calculations and use the reported results. Although not everything need be disclosed, a paper must contain new, useable, and fully described information. For example, a specimen’s chemical composition need not be reported if the main purpose of a paper is to introduce a new measurement technique. Authors should expect to be challenged by reviewers if the results are not supported by adequate data and critical details.
% 		\item Papers that describe ongoing work or announce the latest technical achievement, which are suitable for presentation at a professional conference, may not be appropriate for publication.
