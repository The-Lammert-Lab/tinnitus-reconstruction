  abstract  = {Current study was designed to examine the moderating role of gender between perception of tinnitus and psychological distress among male and female tinnitus patients. Participant consisted of 110 Tinnitus Patients (Male n=70, Female n= 40). Purposive sampling technique was used based on cross-sectional design.Data was collected from various hospitals of Pakistan, through complete otorhinolaryngological (ear) examination. Two scales Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS) and Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) were employed to measure perception of tinnitus, stress, anxiety and depression in tinnitus patients. This study results revealed that gender acted as a moderator among perception of tinnitus, depression, anxiety and stress. The results indicated that gender was positively significant predictor for anxiety ({$\beta$}=.45, p {$<$} .01), depression ({$\beta$}=1.17, p {$<$} .01) in tinnitus patients.The results suggested that females are more prone to anxiety than males. Depression is also perceived more by female tinnitus patients. Outcomes of the study do serve an understanding of psychological ailments among tinnitus patients. It will further help the clinicians to treat the psychological issues related with the physical illness of tinnitus gender wise.},

  abstract   = {Objectives:~         Subjective tinnitus is the sensation of hearing a sound in the absence of an external stimulus. Although an estimated 30 million Americans experience chronic tinnitus, only a small percentage are significantly bothered by the sensation. However, this population is currently in need of effective therapy that reduces the impact of tinnitus. Tinnitus retraining therapy has been promoted as an effective intervention for treating chronic bothersome tinnitus from any etiology. The aim of this study was to compare the effect of tinnitus retraining therapy on the loudness and annoyance of tinnitus with a control group.         Design:~         Subjects with subjective, stable, bothersome, chronic tinnitus, and normal to near-normal hearing in the speech frequencies (average pure-tone thresholds for 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz {$\leq$} 30 dB HL) were recruited to participate in a study for the effect of tinnitus retraining therapy (TRT) on the loudness and annoyance of their tinnitus. Participants were assigned to either the TRT arm or a control arm, with assignment balanced between groups by tinnitus severity. After baseline evaluation, participants received acoustic stimulation devices and 3 mos of individual counseling. An integrated computerized test battery of questionnaires and psychophysical procedures were used to evaluate participants at 6, 12, and 18 mos after enrollment. The primary outcome measure was the change in total score on the tinnitus handicap inventory. Secondary outcome measures were change in global tinnitus impact on a tinnitus experience questionnaire, subjective tinnitus loudness rating, and tinnitus loudness objectively measured using a psychophysical matching procedure.         Results:~         Both TRT and general counseling without additional sound therapy are effective in reducing the annoyance and impact of tinnitus. The largest effect on overall tinnitus handicap was observed in the TRT participants, with an effect size of 1.13. However, a clinically significant effect was also observed in the control group, with an effect size of 0.78.         Conclusions:~         Individuals with moderate to severe tinnitus, without hearing loss in the speech frequency range, benefit from treatment with either TRT or general counseling. The global improvement in tinnitus handicap with TRT accrues over an 18-mo period and seems to be a robust and clinically significant effect.},

A large epidemiologic study of tinnitus and its management patterns in the US adult population is lacking.To quantify the epidemiologic features and effect of tinnitus and to analyze the management of tinnitus in the United States relative to the 2014 American Academy of Otolaryngology\textendash Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) clinical practice guidelines.This cross-sectional analysis of the representative 2007 National Health Interview Survey (raw data, 75\,764 respondents) identified a weighted national sample of adults (age, {$\geq$}18 years) who reported tinnitus in the preceding 12 months. Data were collected in November 2014 at the University of California, Irvine, and Harvard Medical School.In addition to quantifying prevalence, severity, duration, and regularity of tinnitus, specific data regarding noise exposure and tinnitus management patterns during health care visits were analyzed.Among an estimated (SE) 222.1 (3.4) million US adults, 21.4 (3.4) million (9.6\% [0.3\%]) experienced tinnitus in the past 12 months. Among those who reported tinnitus, 27\% had symptoms for longer than 15 years, and 36\% had nearly constant symptoms. Higher rates of tinnitus were reported in those with consistent exposure to loud noises at work (odds ratio, 3.3; 95\% CI, 2.9-3.7) and during recreational time (odds ratio, 2.6; 95\% CI, 2.3-2.9). Years of work-related noise exposure correlated with increasing prevalence of tinnitus (r\,=\,0.13; 95\% CI, 0.10-0.16). In terms of subjective severity, 7.2\% reported their tinnitus as a big or a very big problem compared with 41.6\% who reported it as a small problem. Only 49.4\% had discussed their tinnitus with a physician, and medications were the most frequently discussed recommendation (45.4\%). Other interventions, such as hearing aids (9.2\%), wearable (2.6\%) and nonwearable (2.3\%) masking devices, and cognitive behavioral therapy (0.2\%), were less frequently discussed.The prevalence of tinnitus in the United States is approximately 1 in 10 adults. Durations of occupational and leisure time noise exposures correlated with rates of tinnitus and are likely targetable risk factors. Management options suggested by the recently published AAO-HNSF guidelines were followed infrequently.},

  abstract  = {Compressive sensing is a new signal acquisition technology with the potential to reduce the number of measurements required to acquire signals that are sparse or compressible in some basis. Rather than uniformly sampling the signal, compressive sensing computes inner products with a randomized dictionary of test functions. The signal is then recovered by a convex optimization that ensures the recovered signal is both consistent with the measurements and sparse. Compressive sensing reconstruction has been shown to be robust to multi-level quantization of the measurements, in which the reconstruction algorithm is modified to recover a sparse signal consistent to the quantization measurements. In this paper we consider the limiting case of 1-bit measurements, which preserve only the sign information of the random measurements. Although it is possible to reconstruct using the classical compressive sensing approach by treating the 1-bit measurements as plusmn 1 measurement values, in this paper we reformulate the problem by treating the 1-bit measurements as sign constraints and further constraining the optimization to recover a signal on the unit sphere. Thus the sparse signal is recovered within a scaling factor. We demonstrate that this approach performs significantly better compared to the classical compressive sensing reconstruction methods, even as the signal becomes less sparse and as the number of measurements increases.},

Reverse correlation was used to average the spectrum of the noise prior to each keypress, thus estimating the features of the vowels for which the participants were listening. The formant frequencies of these reverse-correlated vowels were similar to those of their respective whispered vowels. The success of this response-triggered technique suggests that it may prove useful for estimating other internal representations, including perceptual phenomena like tinnitus.},

Building on advances in cognitive neuroscience, we suggest that these proxies are visual reflections of the internal representations that determine how social stimuli are perceived.

In this paper, we investigate 1-bit CS problems for sparse signals using the recently proposed k-support norm. We show that the new estimator has a closed-form solution, so no optimization is needed. We establish consistency and recovery guarantees of the estimator for both Gaussian and sub-Gaussian random measurements. For Gaussian measurements, our estimator is comparable to the best known in the literature, along with guarantees on support recovery. For sub-Gaussian measurements, our estimator has an irreducible error which, unlike existing results, can be controlled by scaling the measurement vectors. In both cases, our analysis covers the setting of model misspecification, i.e., when the true sparsity is unknown. Experimental results illustrate several strengths of the new estimator.},

Internal representations are widely characterized using reverse correlation, a method capable of producing unconstrained estimates of the representation itself, all on the basis of simple responses to random stimuli. Despite its advantages, reverse correlation is often infeasible to apply because of its inefficiency\textemdash a very large number of stimulus\textendash response trials are required in order to obtain an accurate estimate. Here, we show that an important source of this inefficiency is small, yet nontrivial, correlations that occur by chance between randomly generated stimuli. We demonstrate in simulation that whitening stimuli to remove such correlations before eliciting responses provides greater than 85\% improvement in efficiency for a given estimation quality, as well as a two- to fivefold increase in quality for a given sample size. Moreover, unlike conventional approaches, whitening improves the efficiency of reverse correlation without introducing bias into the estimate, or requiring prior knowledge of the target internal representation. Improving the efficiency of reverse correlation with whitening may enable a broader scope of investigations into the individual variability and potential universality of perceptual mechanisms.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a new visualization approach based on a Sensitivity Analysis (SA) to extract human understandable knowledge from supervised learning black box data mining models, such as Neural Networks (NNs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and ensembles, including Random Forests (RFs). Five SA methods (three of which are purely new) and four measures of input importance (one novel) are presented. Also, the SA approach is adapted to handle discrete variables and to aggregate multiple sensitivity responses. Moreover, several visualizations for the SA results are introduced, such as input pair importance color matrix and variable effect characteristic surface. A wide range of experiments was performed in order to test the SA methods and measures by fitting four well-known models (NN, SVM, RF and decision trees) to synthetic datasets (five regression and five classification tasks). In addition, the visualization capabilities of the SA are demonstrated using four real-world datasets (e.g., bank direct marketing and white wine quality).},

  abstract   = {Objectives:~         The Neuromonics Tinnitus Treatment combines the use of a novel approach to acoustic stimulation with a structured program of counseling and support by a clinician specifically trained in tinnitus rehabilitation. The distinctive acoustic component has been designed to provide stimulation to auditory pathways deprived by hearing loss, engage positively with the limbic system, and allow intermittent, momentary tinnitus perception within a pleasant and relaxing stimulus, thereby facilitating desensitization to the tinnitus signal. The purposes of this study were (1) to demonstrate the efficacy of the treatment, when enhanced with various modifications since previously reported trials and (2) to test the relative clinical effectiveness of two variations of the approach. In the first, intermittent tinnitus perception was facilitated throughout treatment through the use of a stimulus in which intensity peaks allowed the patients' tinnitus perception to be completely covered up, whereas in the intensity troughs their tinnitus was briefly discernible. In the second, subjects experienced little tinnitus perception while listening to the treatment for the first 2 mo, then experienced intermittent perception.         Design:~         Thirty-five subjects with a predominantly moderate to severe level of tinnitus-related distress before treatment were randomly allocated into one of two treatment groups, corresponding to the two stage-based variations of the Neuromonics Tinnitus Treatment. Participants were provided with a high-fidelity personal sound player with earphones and an acoustic stimulus that had been spectrally modified according to their individual audiometric profile. They were instructed to use the acoustic stimulus for at least 2 hr per day, particularly at those times when their tinnitus was usually disturbing. Each group had equal amounts of clinician time for education, monitoring, and support.         Results:~         At 2, 4, 6, and 12 mo after commencing treatment, both groups displayed clinically and statistically significant improvements in tinnitus distress, awareness, and minimum masking levels as well as loudness discomfort levels. Improvements increased with time over the first 6 mo of therapy, at which time 91\% of all subjects across the two groups reported an improvement in tinnitus disturbance (as measured by the Tinnitus Reaction Questionnaire) of at least 40\%, with a mean improvement of 65\%. Also, 80\% of subjects at 6 mo reported a level of tinnitus disturbance that was no longer clinically significant. There was some indication of a more consistent benefit over 12 mo for the group that was provided initially with a high level of tinnitus interaction; however, inter-group differences were not statistically significant. A relation between reported treatment usage (hours per day) and clinical outcomes was observed, suggesting that a ``dosage effect'' may apply with the stimulus provided.         Conclusions:~         This study found that the Neuromonics Tinnitus Treatment provides rapid and profound improvements to the severity of tinnitus symptoms and their effect on the subject's quality of life. This was a consistent effect, provided by a treatment that subjects reported as being pleasant to use. Both of the stage-based variations of the treatment that were tested in this study were shown to be successful in achieving these outcomes.},

  abstract   = {In this paper, the problem of one-bit compressed sensing (OBCS) is formulated as a problem in probably approximately correct (PAC) learning. It is shown that the Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC-) dimension of the set of half-spaces in \$\textbackslash mathbb\{R\}\^n\$ generated by \$k\$-sparse vectors is bounded below by \$k \textbackslash lg (n/k)\$ and above by \$2k \textbackslash lg (n/k)\$, plus some round-off terms. By coupling this estimate with well-established results in PAC learning theory, we show that a consistent algorithm can recover a \$k\$-sparse vector with \$O(k \textbackslash lg (n/k))\$ measurements, given only the signs of the measurement vector. This result holds for \textbackslash textit\{all\} probability measures on \$\textbackslash mathbb\{R\}\^n\$. It is further shown that random sign-flipping errors result only in an increase in the constant in the \$O(k \textbackslash lg (n/k))\$ estimate. Because constructing a consistent algorithm is not straight-forward, we present a heuristic based on the \$\textbackslash ell\_1\$-norm support vector machine, and illustrate that its computational performance is superior to a currently popular method.},

The context is the one of 1-bit compressive sensing where the measurements amount to quantizing (dithered) random projections. Our main contribution shows that, in addition to the measurement process, we can additionally reconstruct the signal with a binarization of the sensing matrix. This binary representation of both the measurements and sensing matrix can dramatically simplify the hardware architecture on embedded systems, enabling cheaper and more power efficient alternatives. Within this framework, given a sensing matrix respecting the restricted isometry property (RIP), we prove that for any sparse signal the quantized projected back-projection (QPBP) algorithm achieves a reconstruction error decaying like O(m-1/2)when the number of measurements m increases. Simulations highlight the practicality of the developed scheme for different sensing scenarios, including random partial Fourier sensing.},

In the present study, we compared the shape of tinnitus tuning curves (TTCs) to psychophysical tuning curves (PTCs), the latter using as a target, an external sound that mimics the tinnitus characteristics. A secondary goal was to compare sound levels required to mask tinnitus to those required to mask tinnitus-mimicking sounds. The TTC, PTC, audiometric thresholds, tinnitus pitch, and level matching results of 32 tinnitus patients were analyzed. Narrowband noise maskers were used for both PTC and TTC procedures. Patients were categorized into three groups based on a combination of individual PTC-TTC results. Our findings indicate that in 41\% of cases, the PTC was sharp (V shape), but the TTC showed a flat configuration, suggesting that the tinnitus-related activity in that subgroup does not behave as a regular stimulus-induced activity. In 30\% of cases, V-shape PTC and TTC were found, indicating that the tinnitus-related activity may share common properties with stimulus-induced activity. For a masker centered at the tinnitus frequency, the tinnitus was more difficult to mask than the mimicking tone in 72\% of patients; this was particularly true for the subset with V-shape PTCs and flat TTCs. These results may have implications for subtyping tinnitus and acoustic therapies, in particular those targeting the tinnitus frequency.},

We show that Volterra and Wiener series can be represented implicitly as elements of a reproducing kernel Hilbert space by using polynomial kernels. The estimation complexity of the implicit representation is linear in the input dimensionality and independent of the degree of nonlinearity. Experiments show performance advantages in terms of convergence, interpretability, and system sizes that can be handled.},

There have been several works about BIHT but a theoretical understanding of the corresponding approximation error and convergence rate still remains open. This paper shows that the normalized version of BIHT (NBHIT) achieves an approximation error rate optimal up to logarithmic factors. More precisely, using \$m\$ one-bit measurements of an \$s\$-sparse vector \$x\$, we prove that the approximation error of NBIHT is of order \$O \textbackslash left(1 \textbackslash over m \textbackslash right)\$ up to logarithmic factors, which matches the information-theoretic lower bound \$\textbackslash Omega \textbackslash left(1 \textbackslash over m \textbackslash right)\$ proved by Jacques, Laska, Boufounos, and Baraniuk in 2013. To our knowledge, this is the first theoretical analysis of a BIHT-type algorithm that explains the optimal rate of error decay empirically observed in the literature. This also makes NBIHT the first provable computationally-efficient one-bit compressed sensing algorithm that breaks the inverse square root error decay rate \$O \textbackslash left(1 \textbackslash over m\^\{1/2\} \textbackslash right)\$.},

To this end, we developed Bubbles, a general technique that can assign the credit of human categorization performance to specific visual information.

Complementary to noninvasive imaging, the high spatial and temporal resolution of intracranial recordings has greatly contributed to recent advances in our understanding. However, these approaches are typically limited by piecemeal sampling of the expansive human temporal lobe auditory cortex. Here, we present a functional characterization of local cortical encoding throughout all major regions of the primary and non-primary human auditory cortex. We overcame previous limitations by using rare direct recordings from the surface of the temporal plane after surgical microdissection of the deep Sylvian fissure between the frontal and temporal lobes. We recorded neural responses using simultaneous high-density direct recordings over the left temporal plane and the lateral superior temporal gyrus, while participants listened to natural speech sentences and pure tone stimuli. We found an anatomical separation of simple spectral feature tuning, including tuning for pure tones and absolute pitch, on the superior surface of the temporal plane, and complex tuning for phonological features, relative pitch and speech amplitude modulations on lateral STG. Broadband onset responses are unique to posterior STG and not found elsewhere in auditory cortices. This onset region is functionally distinct from the rest of STG, with latencies similar to primary auditory areas. These findings reveal a new, detailed functional organization of response selectivity to acoustic and phonological features in speech throughout the human auditory cortex.},

  abstract = {A need exists for a standardized tinnitus evaluation tool to measure "acoustic" parameters of tinnitus. An automated tinnitus evaluation system has been developed in this laboratory, consisting of a patient-controlled touch-screen computer monitor, main computer, and Programmable Auditory Laboratory 3000 (PAL 3000) (a custom-built signal conditioning module). The system obtains and records data from tinnitus patients, including hearing thresholds and the pitch and loudness of their tinnitus. New features have been incorporated into the system to make it more user-friendly and practical for clinical application. Using the system, we evaluated 40 individuals with tinnitus to assess within- and between-session reliability of responses. Response reliability has been documented with previous versions of the system. Incorporating the new features has reduced testing time to an average of less than 19 minutes and has resulted in comparable loudness-match reliability and improved pitch-match reliability compared with the previous results. These data support the technique as suitable for clinical application, indicating the need to develop instrumentation for this purpose.},

  abstract   = {BACKGROUND: Psychoacoustic measures of tinnitus typically include loudness and pitch match, minimum masking level (MML), and residual inhibition (RI). We previously developed and documented a computer-automated tinnitus evaluation system (TES) capable of subject-guided loudness and pitch matching. The TES was further developed to conduct computer-aided, subject-guided testing for noise-band matching (NBM), MML, and RI. PURPOSE: The purpose of the present study was to document the capability of the upgraded TES to obtain measures of NBM, MML, and RI, and to determine the test-retest reliability of the responses obtained. RESEARCH DESIGN: Three subject-guided, computer-automated testing protocols were developed to conduct NBM. For MML and RI testing, a 2-12 kHz band of noise was used. All testing was repeated during a second session. STUDY SAMPLE: Subjects meeting study criteria were selected from those who had previously been tested for loudness and pitch matching in our laboratory. A total of 21 subjects completed testing, including seven females and 14 males. RESULTS: The upgraded TES was found to be fairly time efficient. Subjects were generally reliable, both within and between sessions, with respect to the type of stimulus they chose as the best match to their tinnitus. Matching to bandwidth was more variable between measurements, with greater consistency seen for subjects reporting tonal tinnitus or wide-band noisy tinnitus than intermediate types. Between-session repeated MMLs were within 10 dB of each other for all but three of the subjects. Subjects who experienced RI during Session 1 tended to be those who experienced it during Session 2. CONCLUSIONS: This study may represent the first time that NBM, MML, and RI audiometric testing results have been obtained entirely through a self-contained, computer-automated system designed specifically for use in the clinic. Future plans include refinements to achieve greater testing efficiency.},

  abstract = {Chronic tinnitus is the persistent sensation of hearing a sound that exists only inside the head. The prevalence of tinnitus in adults in the United States is estimated at 10 to 15\%. For about 20\% of these individuals the tinnitus is significantly bothersome. Although myriad therapies for tinnitus are offered (often at significant cost), most are not evidence based. Difficulty in the assessment and further development of interventions for tinnitus stems from the limitations of techniques used to evaluate these interventions. Questionnaires are widely available to ``measure'' (tinnitus can only be indirectly measured) functional effects of tinnitus, such as difficulty sleeping and concentrating, and negative emotions such as anxiety, depression, and annoyance. Questionnaires have recently been documented for sensitivity to change in response to intervention (i.e., ``responsiveness''). All of these questionnaires function well to assess the overall impact of tinnitus. The limitations mentioned pertain primarily to measures of tinnitus perception, which typically include the psychoacoustic measures of tinnitus loudness and pitch matches, tinnitus spectral content, minimum masking levels, and residual inhibition. These measures, which are obtained routinely in many clinics and as part of research studies, have not been validated for being diagnostic, prognostic, discriminative, or responsive. In order for these measures to become clinically meaningful, normative standards are needed, both for baseline measures and for repeated measures of tinnitus perception. Evidence-based intervention for tinnitus requires accurately measuring both the perception of, and reactions to, tinnitus.},

  abstract      = {Logistic regression has been widely applied in the field of biomedical research for a long time. In some applications, covariates of interest have a natural structure, such as being a matrix, at the time of collection. The rows and columns of the covariate matrix then have certain physical meanings, and they must contain useful information regarding the response. If we simply stack the covariate matrix as a vector and fit the conventional logistic regression model, relevant information can be lost, and the problem of inefficiency will arise. Motivated from these reasons, we propose in this paper the matrix variate logistic (MV-logistic) regression model. Advantages of MV-logistic regression model include the preservation of the inherent matrix structure of covariates and the parsimony of parameters needed. In the EEG Database Data Set, we successfully extract the structural effects of covariate matrix, and a high classification accuracy is achieved.},

  abstract   = {Purpose In the past decade, resting-state functional connectivity, acquired using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), has emerged as a popular measure of tinnitus, especially as related to self-reported handicap or psychological reaction. The goal of this study was to assess replicability of neural correlates of tinnitus, namely, resting-state functional connectivity, in the same individuals acquired over 2 sessions. Method Data were collected at 2 different sites (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and Joint Base San Antonio Wilford Hall Ambulatory Surgical Center) using similar 3T magnets and similar data acquisition paradigms. Thirty-six patients (all civilians) were scanned using resting-state fMRI at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Ten patients, active-duty Service members and Veterans, were scanned at the Wilford Hall Ambulatory Surgical Center and the Department of Defense Hearing Center of Excellence. Each participant was scanned twice, a week apart, using identical protocols of 10 min resting-state fMRI. Results Tinnitus handicap scores using the Tinnitus Functional Index and the Tinnitus Primary Function Questionnaire ranged between no or mild handicap to moderately severe handicap but did not significantly differ between visits. We examined the default mode, dorsal attention, and auditory resting-state networks and found that the strength of the within-network functional connections across visit was similar for the attention and default mode networks but not for the auditory network. In addition, the functional connection between the attention network and precuneus, a region of the default mode network, was also replicable across visits. Conclusions Our results show that resting-state fMRI measures are replicable and reliable in patients with a subjective condition, although some networks and functional connections may be more stable than others. This paves the way for using resting-state fMRI to measure the efficacy of tinnitus interventions and as a tool to help propose better management options.},

We present a new class of convex optimization programs, or decoders, coined Basis Pursuit DeQuantizer of moment p (BPDQp), that model the quantization distortion more faithfully than the commonly used Basis Pursuit DeNoise (BPDN) program. Our decoders proceed by minimizing the sparsity of the signal to be reconstructed subject to a data-fidelity constraint expressed in the {$\mathscr{l}$}p-norm of the residual error for 2 {$\leq$} p {$\leq$} {$\infty$}. We show theoretically that, (i) the reconstruction error of these new decoders is bounded if the sensing matrix satisfies an extended Restricted Isometry Property involving the I{$\rho$} norm, and (ii), for Gaussian random matrices and uniformly quantized measurements, BPDQp performance exceeds that of BPDN by dividing the reconstruction error due to quantization by {$\surd$}(p + 1). This last effect happens with high probability when the number of measurements exceeds a value growing with p, i.e., in an oversampled situation compared to what is commonly required by BPDN = BPDQ2. To demonstrate the theoretical power of BPDQp, we report numerical simulations on signal and image reconstruction problems.},

  abstract = {This year marks 25 years of tinnitus retraining therapy (TRT), the approach that aims to eliminate tinnitus as a problem by extinguishing functional connections between the auditory and the limbic and autonomic nervous systems to achieve habituation of tinnitus-evoked reactions and subsequently habituation of perception. TRT addresses directly decreased sound tolerance (DST) as well as tinnitus. TRT consists of counseling and sound therapy, both based on the neurophysiological model of tinnitus. The main goal of retraining counseling is to reclassify tinnitus into the category of a neutral stimulus, while the main goal of sound therapy is to decrease the strength of tinnitus-related neuronal activity. A unique aspect of TRT is that because treatment is aimed to work above the tinnitus source, and at connections linking the auditory and other systems in the brain, the etiology of tinnitus is irrelevant. Any type of tinnitus, as well as somatosounds, can be successfully treated by TRT. Over 100 publications can be found on Medline when using "tinnitus retraining therapy" as a search term. The majority of these publications indicate TRT offers significant help for about 80\,\% of patients. A randomized clinical trial showing the effectiveness of TRT has been published and another large study is in progress. The principles of the neurophysiological model of tinnitus, and consequently TRT, have not changed in over 25 years of use, but a number of changes have been introduced in TRT implementation. These changes include the recognition of the importance of conditioned reflexes and the dominant role of the subconscious pathways; the introduction of the concept of misophonia (i.e., negative reactions to specific patterns of sound) and the implementation of specific protocols for its treatment; greater emphasis on the concurrent treatment of tinnitus, hyperacusis, misophonia, and hearing loss; extensive modification of counseling; and refinements in sound therapy. The effectiveness of TRT has increased significantly during the past 25 years, presumably due to changes incorporated in its implementation. The main improvement has been to shorten the average time until seeing clear improvement from 1 year to 1 month, with a statistically significant improvement seen at, and after, 3 months. Furthermore, there is a higher effectiveness and a shorter treatment time for DST and an increased extent of help for hearing loss.},

While various techniques exist for the recovery of real-valued sparse signals from compressive 1-bit measurements, the BIHT algorithm remains one of the most accurate methods to date. However, BIHT only considers signals with a sparse representation in a real basis. In order to make sense of the quantization operation during reconstruction, the algorithm is adapted to account for the symmetric structure of the underlying conjugate symmetric signal space. In particular, the classical hard thresholding operator is modified in such a way as to only produce approximations with a real-valued inverse Fourier transform. In addition to BIHT, this also enables well-known algorithms such as Iterative Hard Thresholding and Hard Thresholding Pursuit from the Compressed Sensing literature to be used for the recovery of frequency-sparse signals from compressive time domain samples. Numerical experiments validate the correct behavior of the proposed method.},

The focus lies on matrices with a constant modulus constraint which, e.g., represent a network of analog phase shifters in hybrid precoding/combining architectures. We interpret a matrix with restricted isometry property as a mapping from a high- to a low-dimensional hypersphere. We argue that points on the low-dimensional hypersphere should be uniformly distributed to combat measurement noise. This notion is formalized as an optimization problem which uses a maximum mean discrepancy metric as objective function. Recent success of such metrics in neural network related topics motivate a solution of the optimization problem based on machine learning. Numerical experiments show a better performance than random matrices that are typical for compressive sensing. Further, we adapt a method from the literature to the constant modulus constraint. This method can also compete with random matrices and harmonizes well with the proposed algorithm if it is used as an initialization. Lastly, we describe how other structural matrix constraints, e.g., a Toeplitz constraint, can be taken into account as well.},

We evaluated repetitive recursive matching using an iPod-based matching procedure as a method to estimate a patient's PM frequency without audiometric equipment. METHODS: One hundred and seventeen patients with chronic tonal tinnitus (uni- and bilateral tinnitus) measured their tinnitus in 10 sessions using a self-administered automated iPod-based procedure comprising a recursive 2 interval forced-choice test. RESULTS: Mean SD of the PM frequency of all participants across sessions was 0.41 octaves. The internal consistency measured by Cronbach's {$\alpha$} was very high (0.8-{$>$}0.95). As an example, 7 PMs obtained excellent internal consistency ({$\alpha$} = 0.93). The exclusion of the first and/or second session led to more definite PMs with a decreased SD. Outliers were identified by PMs departing 2 SDs (i.e., 0.94 octaves) from the mean variability (n = 5). CONCLUSION: Repetitive recursive matching together with recommendations for the exclusion of initial and redundant sessions as well as outlier identification and treatment can enable a reliable estimation of the PM frequency.},

To this end, we propose Model Understanding through Subspace Explanations (MUSE), a novel model agnostic framework which facilitates understanding of a given black box model by explaining how it behaves in subspaces characterized by certain features of interest. Our framework provides end users (e.g., doctors) with the flexibility of customizing the model explanations by allowing them to input the features of interest. The construction of explanations is guided by a novel objective function that we propose to simultaneously optimize for fidelity to the original model, unambiguity and interpretability of the explanation. More specifically, our objective allows us to learn, with optimality guarantees, a small number of compact decision sets each of which captures the behavior of a given black box model in unambiguous, well-defined regions of the feature space. Experimental evaluation with real-world datasets and user studies demonstrate that our approach can generate customizable, highly compact, easy-to-understand, yet accurate explanations of various kinds of predictive models compared to state-of-the-art baselines.},

Consequently, the conclusions that can be derived from these studies are limited and jeopardize comparison between studies.

  abstract   = {Purpose: Prior image constrained compressed sensing (PICCS) is an image reconstruction framework which incorporates an often available prior image into the compressed sensing objective function. The images are reconstructed using an optimization procedure. In this paper, several alternative unconstrained minimization methods are used to implement PICCS. The purpose is to study and compare the performance of each implementation, as well as to evaluate the performance of the PICCS objective function with respect to image quality. Methods: Six different minimization methods are investigated with respect to convergence speed and reconstruction accuracy. These minimization methods include the steepest descent (SD) method and the conjugate gradient (CG) method. These algorithms require a line search to be performed. Thus, for each minimization algorithm, two line searching algorithms are evaluated: a backtracking (BT) line search and a fast Newton-Raphson (NR) line search. The relative root mean square error is used to evaluate the reconstruction accuracy. The algorithm that offers the best convergence speed is used to study the performance of PICCS with respect to the prior image parameter {$\alpha$} and the data consistency parameter {$\lambda$}. PICCS is studied in terms of reconstruction accuracy, low-contrast spatial resolution, and noise characteristics. A numerical phantom was simulated and an animal model was scanned using a multirow detector computed tomography (CT) scanner to yield the projection datasets used in this study. Results: For {$\lambda$} within a broad range, the CG method with Fletcher-Reeves formula and NR line search offers the fastest convergence for an equal level of reconstruction accuracy. Using this minimization method, the reconstruction accuracy of PICCS was studied with respect to variations in {$\alpha$} and {$\lambda$}. When the number of view angles is varied between 107, 80, 64, 40, 20, and 16, the relative root mean square error reaches a minimum value for {$\alpha$} {$\approx$} 0.5. For values of {$\alpha$} near the optimal value, the spatial resolution of the reconstructed image remains relatively constant and the noise texture is very similar to that of the prior image, which was reconstructed using the filtered backprojection (FBP) algorithm. Conclusions: Regarding the performance of the minimization methods, the nonlinear CG method with NR line search yields the best convergence speed. Regarding the performance of the PICCS image reconstruction, three main conclusions can be reached. (1) The performance of PICCS is optimal when the weighting parameter of the prior image parameter is selected to be near {$\alpha$} = 0.5. (2) The spatial resolution measured for static objects in images reconstructed using PICCS from undersampled datasets is not degraded with respect to the fully-sampled reconstruction for {$\alpha$} near its optimal value. (3) The noise texture of PICCS reconstructions is similar to that of the prior image, which was reconstructed using the conventional FBP method.},

  abstract   = {Face pareidolia is the illusory perception of non-existent faces. The present study, for the first time, contrasted behavioral and neural responses of face pareidolia with those of letter pareidolia to explore face-specific behavioral and neural responses during illusory face processing. Participants were shown pure-noise images but were led to believe that 50\% of them contained either faces or letters; they reported seeing faces or letters illusorily 34\% and 38\% of the time, respectively. The right fusiform face area (rFFA) showed a specific response when participants ``saw'' faces as opposed to letters in the pure-noise images. Behavioral responses during face pareidolia produced a classification image (CI) that resembled a face, whereas those during letter pareidolia produced a CI that was letter-like. Further, the extent to which such behavioral CIs resembled faces was directly related to the level of face-specific activations in the rFFA. This finding suggests that the rFFA plays a specific role not only in processing of real faces but also in illusory face perception, perhaps serving to facilitate the interaction between bottom-up information from the primary visual cortex and top-down signals from the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Whole brain analyses revealed a network specialized in face pareidolia, including both the frontal and occipitotemporal regions. Our findings suggest that human face processing has a strong top-down component whereby sensory input with even the slightest suggestion of a face can result in the interpretation of a face.},

Perceivers as well as scientists have hitherto had little success in articulating just what information we are employing to achieve these subjectively immediate and effortless classifications. We describe here a method that estimates that information. Observers classified faces in high levels of visual noise as male or female (in a gender task), happy/unhappy (in an expression task), or Tom Cruise/John Travolta (in an individuation task). They were unaware that the underlying face (which was midway between each of the classes) was identical throughout a task, with only the noise rendering it more like one category value or the other. The difference between the average of noise patterns for each classification decision provided a linear estimate of the information mediating these classifications. When the noise was combined with the underlying face, the resultant images appeared to be excellent prototypes of their respective classes. Other methods of estimating the information employed in complex classification have relied on judgments of exemplars of a class or tests of experimenter-defined hypotheses about the class information. Our method allows an estimate, however subtle, of what is in the subject's (rather than the experimenter's) head.},

  abstract  = {IntroductionEarly in the study of the dynamics of a physiological system the bioscientist is faced with the task of recognizing the domains of linearity and of nonlinearity of the stimulus-response transformation that the system performs and how these domains compare with the dominant natural variation of the stimuli in the system's environment. As we saw in the previous chapter, the analytical advantages of linear systems are many, and, therefore, they justify the search for a linear domain in the system's operational range (if such exists). However, the bioscientist must resist the temptation of being carried away by a natural desire for beautiful and explicit solutions since they often tend to be unrealistic idealizations. We cannot but bow to the evidence that nonlinear system characteristics are abundant in nature and go far beyond the trite admission that every physical system is in some way nonlinear. In much the same way that nonlinearities optimize the design of artificial systems, nonlinearities seem to be necessary for the optimal functioning of physiological systems from the behavioral point of view. There are many such examples: the logarithmic transformation of sensory input in order to accommodate large stimulus ranges, dynamic asymmetries arising from such physiological necessities as sensing direction, and many others.Faced, therefore, with nonlinear physiological systems, for which the principle of superposition does not hold, the question naturally arises as to which types of test stimuli should be applied, so that from the resulting responses the bioscientist is able to deduce (or learn as much as possible about) the functional relationship between the stimulus and response of the system. The application of sinusoidal stimuli is certainly unpromising since the response of the system to two such stimuli of different frequencies is different, in general, from the sum of the responses due to each stimulus separately\textemdash so no additional information is gained besides the sinusoidal behavior. In general, the same will hold true for other types of stimulus such as steps, pulses, etc. Figure 4.1 illustrates the situation. If a pulse stimulus is applied, we learn the response of the system to this pulse and have little notion of the response of the system to any other type of stimulus. If the stimulus consists of two triangular pulses as shown in the figure, then we know the response of the system to these two triangular pulses and little else. The same applies for any other specific waveform, such as the one shown in part C of the same figure. Therefore, faced with a nonlinear system it appears that we can do nothing less than test it with a great variety of stimuli and catalog the responses to them. This is exactly what a white-noise stimulus accomplishes in an efficient manner.},

Assuming the original signal vector to be sparse, existing results in 1bCS either aim to find the support of the vector, or approximate the signal within an \$\textbackslash epsilon\$-ball. The focus of this paper is support recovery, which often also computationally facilitate approximate signal recovery. A \textbackslash emph\{universal\} measurement matrix for 1bCS refers to one set of measurements that work \textbackslash emph\{for all\} sparse signals. With universality, it is known that \$\textbackslash tilde\{\textbackslash Theta\}(k\^2)\$ 1bCS measurements are necessary and sufficient for support recovery (where \$k\$ denotes the sparsity). In this work, we show that it is possible to universally recover the support with a small number of false positives with \$\textbackslash tilde\{O\}(k\^\{3/2\})\$ measurements. If the dynamic range of the signal vector is known, then with a different technique, this result can be improved to only \$\textbackslash tilde\{O\}(k)\$ measurements.

  abstract = {Objectives New tinnitus therapies are being developed and marketed that target the patient's tinnitus frequency. This frequency is estimated clinically by pitch matching, which has the patient identify the pure tone that is closest to the perceived tinnitus frequency. Though widely used, pitch matching is heavily criticized as unreliable, and the degree of reliability varies among patients. At the very least, it is recommended that multiple pitch matches be used to identify the patient's tinnitus frequency. Even so, it is not clear how many pitch matches to collect, how they should be combined, or how doing so will enhance the audiologist's certainty about the true tinnitus frequency. In this article, we describe a simple Bayesian method of sequentially combining pitch matches until acceptable precision is achieved and illustrate the method in 10 patients with chronic tinnitus. Design Subjects were recruited from previous study participants and support group attendees at the National Center for Rehabilitative Auditory Research. Thirty tinnitus pitch matches were elicited from 10 patients with chronic, monotonal tinnitus. Results A Bayesian sequential analysis yielded estimated tinnitus frequencies for 7 patients that were within one-quarter octave of their true value with 90\% certainty. Between four and twenty pitch matches were required to achieve acceptable results in these seven patients. Conclusions Despite criticism, pitch matching is widely used to estimate tinnitus frequency. We address reliability concerns with a Bayesian sequential analysis to jointly estimate tinnitus frequency and reliability. The method is easily applied.},

  abstract = {The bubbles method is a recently developed variant of reverse correlation methods that have been used in psychophysics and physiology. We show mathematically that for the broad and important class of noisy linear observers, the bubbles method recovers much less information about how observers process stimuli than reverse correlation does. We also show experimentally that the unusual type of noise used in the bubbles method can drastically change human observers' strategies in psychophysical tasks, which reduces the value of the information that is obtained from a bubbles experiment. We conclude that reverse correlation is generally preferable to the bubbles method in its present form, but we also give suggestions as to how the bubbles method could be modified to avoid the problems we discuss.},

  abstract   = {We can better understand deep neural networks by identifying which features each of their neurons have learned to detect. To do so, researchers have created Deep Visualization techniques including activation maximization, which synthetically generates inputs (e.g. images) that maximally activate each neuron. A limitation of current techniques is that they assume each neuron detects only one type of feature, but we know that neurons can be multifaceted, in that they fire in response to many different types of features: for example, a grocery store class neuron must activate either for rows of produce or for a storefront. Previous activation maximization techniques constructed images without regard for the multiple different facets of a neuron, creating inappropriate mixes of colors, parts of objects, scales, orientations, etc. Here, we introduce an algorithm that explicitly uncovers the multiple facets of each neuron by producing a synthetic visualization of each of the types of images that activate a neuron. We also introduce regularization methods that produce state-of-the-art results in terms of the interpretability of images obtained by activation maximization. By separately synthesizing each type of image a neuron fires in response to, the visualizations have more appropriate colors and coherent global structure. Multifaceted feature visualization thus provides a clearer and more comprehensive description of the role of each neuron.},

In the last decades it has developed from a quasi-professional working field into an increasingly evidence-based treatment for various diseases. Selected outcome studies that were carried out in order to give music therapy a scientific and empirical base are presented in this article. Results show that music therapy is an effective intervention for patients with chronic pain, children with migraine, and patients suffering from chronic tinnitus. This positive outcome, in combination with the observed moderate to large effect sizes in different metanalyses, provides evidence for the use of music therapy in specific clinical fields. Future research should focus on studies that compare well-defined music therapy interventions to standard treatment.},

The method is based on spectral analyses in a two-dimensional spatial frequency domain for spatially localized areas within and around their receptive fields. Extracellular single-unit recordings were performed for area 17 and 18 neurons in anesthetized cats. A dynamic dense noise pattern was presented in which the pattern covered an area two to three times larger than the classical receptive field. Spike trains were then cross-correlated with frequency spectra of localized noise pattern to obtain spatially localized selectivity maps in the two-dimensional frequency domain. Our findings are as follows. (1) The new LSRC method allows measurements of two-dimensional frequency tunings and their spatial extent even for cells with substantial nonlinearity. (2) A small subset of neurons shows spatial inhomogeneity in the two-dimensional frequency tunings. (3) In addition to facilitatory response profiles, we can also visualize suppressive profiles localized both in space and spatial frequency domains. Our results suggest that the new analysis technique can be a powerful tool for measuring visual response profiles that contain inhomogeneity in space, as well as for studying neurons with substantial nonlinearities. These features make the method particularly suitable for studying response profiles of neurons in early as well as intermediate extrastriate visual areas.},

  abstract   = {In this study, an original psychometric procedure was used in order to characterize in more detail than in previous studies the different perceptual components of tinnitus, i.e. auditory sensations which are perceived in the absence of a corresponding external acoustic stimulus. Ten subjects with chronic tinnitus were asked to rate on a numeric scale the contribution of elementary pitch sensations evoked by isolated frequency components to their overall tinnitus sensation. The resulting 'internal tinnitus spectra', which represented the estimated perceptual contribution to the tinnitus sensation as a function of frequency over a large range of frequencies, were found to occupy a wide frequency range corresponding largely to that at which hearing thresholds were abnormally elevated. In most cases, they exhibited a broad peak falling within the hearing loss range. This pattern of result suggests that in subjects with high-frequency hearing loss, tinnitus sensations, when present, resemble those evoked by high-frequency noise bands with, in some cases, a superimposed tonal-like pitch. These results confirm and extend earlier results in the literature and agree with the patients' reports; their practical implications for the design of future studies on tinnitus and theoretical implications for the understanding of the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying tinnitus are discussed. The results of an additional experiment showed that the internal tinnitus spectrum could be altered by perceptual training in a fine frequency discrimination task with tones in the frequency range of the main peak of the tinnitus spectrum.},

  abstract     = {Compressive sensing has emerged as an area that opens new perspectives in signal acquisition and processing. It appears as an alternative to the traditional sampling theory, endeavoring to reduce the required number of samples for successful signal reconstruction. In practice, compressive sensing aims to provide saving in sensing resources, transmission, and storage capacities and to facilitate signal processing in the circumstances when certain data are unavailable. To that end, compressive sensing relies on the mathematical algorithms solving the problem of data reconstruction from a greatly reduced number of measurements by exploring the properties of sparsity and incoherence. Therefore, this concept includes the optimization procedures aiming to provide the sparsest solution in a suitable representation domain. This work, therefore, offers a survey of the compressive sensing idea and prerequisites, together with the commonly used reconstruction methods. Moreover, the compressive sensing problem formulation is considered in signal processing applications assuming some of the commonly used transformation domains, namely, the Fourier transform domain, the polynomial Fourier transform domain, Hermite transform domain, and combined time-frequency domain.},

We show that a single convex program gives an accurate estimate of the signal, or coefficient vector, for both of these models. We demonstrate that an s-sparse signal in R\^n can be accurately estimated from m = O(slog(n/s)) single-bit measurements using a simple convex program. This remains true even if each measurement bit is flipped with probability nearly 1/2. Worst-case (adversarial) noise can also be accounted for, and uniform results that hold for all sparse inputs are derived as well. In the terminology of sparse logistic regression, we show that O(slog(n/s)) Bernoulli trials are sufficient to estimate a coefficient vector in R\^n which is approximately s-sparse. Moreover, the same convex program works for virtually all generalized linear models, in which the link function may be unknown. To our knowledge, these are the first results that tie together the theory of sparse logistic regression to 1-bit compressed sensing. Our results apply to general signal structures aside from sparsity; one only needs to know the size of the set K where signals reside.

  abstract  = {Human listeners excel at forming high-level social representations about each other, even from the briefest of utterances. In particular, pitch is widely recognized as the auditory dimension that conveys most of the information about a speaker's traits, emotional states, and attitudes. While past research has primarily looked at the influence of mean pitch, almost nothing is known about how intonation patterns, i.e., finely tuned pitch trajectories around the mean, may determine social judgments in speech. Here, we introduce an experimental paradigm that combines state-of-the-art voice transformation algorithms with psychophysical reverse correlation and show that two of the most important dimensions of social judgments, a speaker's perceived dominance and trustworthiness, are driven by robust and distinguishing pitch trajectories in short utterances like the word ``Hello,'' which remained remarkably stable whether male or female listeners judged male or female speakers. These findings reveal a unique communicative adaptation that enables listeners to infer social traits regardless of speakers' physical characteristics, such as sex and mean pitch. By characterizing how any given individual's mental representations may differ from this generic code, the method introduced here opens avenues to explore dysprosody and social-cognitive deficits in disorders like autism spectrum and schizophrenia. In addition, once derived experimentally, these prototypes can be applied to novel utterances, thus providing a principled way to modulate personality impressions in arbitrary speech signals.},

  abstract = {Acoustic stimulation with hearing aids or noise devices is frequently used in tinnitus therapy. However, such behind-the-ear devices are limited in their high-frequency output with an upper cut-off frequency of approximately 5\textendash 6~kHz. Theoretical modeling suggests that acoustic stimulation treatments with these devices might be most effective when the tinnitus pitch is within the stimulated frequency range. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a pilot study with 15 subjects with chronic tinnitus. Eleven subjects received hearing aids and four subjects noise devices. Perceived tinnitus loudness was measured using a visual analog scale, and tinnitus-related distress was assessed using the Tinnitus Questionnaire. After six months of device usage, reductions of perceived tinnitus loudness were seen only in subjects with a tinnitus pitch of less than 6~kHz. When subjects were grouped by tinnitus pitch, the group of patients with a tinnitus pitch of less than 6~kHz (n~=~10 subjects) showed a significant reduction in perceived tinnitus loudness (from 73.4~{$\pm~$}6.1 before to 56.4~{$\pm~$}7.4 after treatment, p~=~0.012), whereas in subjects with a tinnitus pitch of 6~kHz or more (n~=~5 subjects) tinnitus loudness was slightly increased after six months of treatment (65.0~{$\pm~$}4.7 before and 70.6~{$\pm~$}5.9 after treatment), but the increase was not significant (p~=~0.063). Likewise, tinnitus-related distress was significantly decreased in the low-pitch group (from 31.6~{$\pm~$}4.3 to 20.9~{$\pm~$}4.8, p~=~0.0059), but not in the group with high-pitched tinnitus (30.2~{$\pm~$}3.3 before and 30.0~{$\pm~$}5.1 after treatment, p~=~1). Overall, reductions in tinnitus-related distress in our study were less pronounced than those reported for more comprehensive treatments. However, the differences we observed between the low- and the high-pitch group show that tinnitus pitch might influence the outcome of acoustic stimulation treatments when devices with a limited frequency range are used.},

  abstract = {The study of internal knowledge representations is a cornerstone of the research agenda in the interdisciplinary study of~cognition. An influential proposal assumes that the brain~uses its internal knowledge of the external world to constrain, in a top-down manner, high-dimensional sensory data into a lower-dimensional representation that enables perceptual decisions and other higher-level cognitive functions [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. This proposal relies on a precise formulation of~the observer-specific internal knowledge (i.e., the internal representations, or models) that guides reduction of the high-dimensional retinal input onto a low-dimensional code. Here, we directly revealed the content of subjective internal representations by instructing five observers to detect~a face in the presence of only white noise, to force a pure top-down, knowledge-based task. We used reverse correlation methods to visualize each observer's internal representation that supports detection of an illusory face. Using reverse correlation again, this time applied to observers' electroencephalogram activity, we established where and when in the brain specific internal knowledge conceptually interprets the input white noise as a face. We show that internal representations can be reconstructed experimentally from behavioral and brain data, and that their content drives neural activity first over frontal and then over occipitotemporal cortex.},

  abstract = {Objective Notch-filtered music has been shown to induce frequency-specific inhibition. Here, we investigated which cortical structures are affected by tailor-made notched music (TMNM) in tinnitus patients and how this inhibition-induced plasticity develops over time. Methods Nine subjects suffering from chronic tonal tinnitus listened to music passing through a notch-filter centered at the patient's individual tinnitus frequency (TMNM) for three hours on three consecutive days. Before and after each listening session, a tone at the tinnitus frequency and a control tone of 500Hz were presented in the magnetoencephalograph. Subjective tinnitus loudness was measured via visual analog scales. Results TMNM exposure reduced subjective tinnitus loudness and neural activity evoked by the tinnitus tone in temporal, parietal and frontal regions within the N1m time interval. Reduction of temporal and frontal activation correlated significantly with tinnitus loudness decline. Reduction of tinnitus related neural activity persisted and accumulated over three days. Conclusions Inhibition-induced plasticity occurs in a cortical network, known to be crucial for tinnitus perception. This cortical reorganization evolves fast and accumulates across sessions. Significance This study extends previous work on inhibition-induced plasticity, as it demonstrates the involvement of parietal and frontal areas and discovers a cumulative effect of cortical reorganization in tinnitus patients.},

  abstract  = {Compressed Sensing is mostly known for finding exact or approximate solutions for underdetermined linear systems of equations, which could not be solved using traditional linear algebra techniques. It showed that sampling under the Shannon\textendash Nyquist rate is no longer impossible. In a nutshell, a small number of measurements obtained by multiplying a sufficiently large signal by a well-defined matrix can be recovered with high probability. As a result, Compressed Sensing gained tremendous interest from research and industry as a powerful signal processing tool for images and audio compression. Recently, the attention to this disruptive technique has spawned to the point where we witness its presence in various fields, including communications. Motivated by the fact that the data in general could be temporally and spatially correlated, which could be translated into sparsity in both domains, Compressed Sensing has become essential for power-constrained devices with challenged network conditions, such as Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), by allowing them to reduce their transmission frequencies and the sizes of their generated packets. This chapter focuses on providing elementary tools for understanding the theory behind Compressed Sensing and discusses the major communications works/trends where it has imposed itself.},

  abstract  = {Speech processing relies on interactions between auditory and motor systems and is asymmetrically organized in the human brain. The left auditory system is specialized for processing of phonemes, whereas the right is specialized for processing of pitch changes in speech affecting prosody. In speakers of tonal languages, however, processing of pitch (i.e., tone) changes that alter word meaning is left-lateralized indicating that linguistic function and language experience shape speech processing asymmetries. Here, we investigated the asymmetry of motor contributions to auditory speech processing in male and female speakers of tonal and non-tonal languages. We temporarily disrupted the right or left speech motor cortex using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and measured the impact of these disruptions on auditory discrimination (mismatch negativity; MMN) responses to phoneme and tone changes in sequences of syllables using electroencephalography (EEG). We found that the effect of motor disruptions on processing of tone changes differed between language groups: disruption of the right speech motor cortex suppressed responses to tone changes in non-tonal language speakers, whereas disruption of the left speech motor cortex suppressed responses to tone changes in tonal language speakers. In non-tonal language speakers, the effects of disruption of left speech motor cortex on responses to tone changes were inconclusive. For phoneme changes, disruption of left but not right speech motor cortex suppressed responses in both language groups. We conclude that the contributions of the right and left speech motor cortex to auditory speech processing are determined by the functional roles of acoustic cues in the listener's native language. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The principles underlying hemispheric asymmetries of auditory speech processing remain debated. The asymmetry of processing of speech sounds is affected by low-level acoustic cues, but also by their linguistic function. By combining transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalography (EEG), we investigated the asymmetry of motor contributions to auditory speech processing in tonal and non-tonal language speakers. We provide causal evidence that the functional role of the acoustic cues in the listener's native language affects the asymmetry of motor influences on auditory speech discrimination ability [indexed by mismatch negativity (MMN) responses]. Lateralized top-down motor influences can affect asymmetry of speech processing in the auditory system.},

Results: The 18 studies evaluated cognitive function using 24 different objective behavioural tests, nine electrophysiological recordings, one oculomotor test, and one self-report questionnaire. The studies spanned 18 years and revealed numerous interactions potentially contributing to the cognitive difficulties frequently reported by people with invasive tinnitus. The studies indicate a clear association between tinnitus and aspects of cognitive function, specifically the executive control of attention. Conclusions: Tinnitus impairs cognitive function by way of impact upon executive control of attention. Clinical management of patients reporting tinnitus and cognitive difficulties requires an understanding of the reciprocal relationship between tinnitus and cognitive function, with additive effects of anxiety, depression, and somatic cognitive bias. Further study is required to establish the impact of advancing age, hearing loss, anxiety, depression tinnitus duration, and distress upon cognitive function in people with invasive tinnitus.},

  abstract  = {Selection of an efficient model parametrization (model order, delay, etc.) has crucial importance in parametric system identification. It navigates a trade-off between representation capabilities of the model (structural bias) and effects of over-parametrization (variance increase of the estimates). There exists many approaches to this widely studied problem in terms of statistical regularization methods and information criteria. In this paper, an alternative {$\mathscr{l}$}1 regularization scheme is proposed for estimation of sparse linear-regression models based on recent results in compressive sensing. It is shown that the proposed scheme provides consistent estimation of sparse models in terms of the so-called oracle property, it is computationally attractive for large-scale over-parameterized models and it is applicable in case of small data sets, i.e., underdetermined estimation problems. The performance of the approach w.r.t. other regularization schemes is demonstrated in an extensive Monte Carlo study.},

  abstract   = {ObjectiveTinnitus is the perception of sound without an external source. More than 50 million people in the United States have reported experiencing tinnitus, resulting in an estimated prevalence of 10\% to 15\% in adults. Despite the high prevalence of tinnitus and its potential significant effect on quality of life, there are no evidence-based, multidisciplinary clinical practice guidelines to assist clinicians with management. The focus of this guideline is on tinnitus that is both bothersome and persistent (lasting 6 months or longer), which often negatively affects the patient?s quality of life. The target audience for the guideline is any clinician, including nonphysicians, involved in managing patients with tinnitus. The target patient population is limited to adults (18 years and older) with primary tinnitus that is persistent and bothersome.PurposeThe purpose of this guideline is to provide evidence-based recommendations for clinicians managing patients with tinnitus. This guideline provides clinicians with a logical framework to improve patient care and mitigate the personal and social effects of persistent, bothersome tinnitus. It will discuss the evaluation of patients with tinnitus, including selection and timing of diagnostic testing and specialty referral to identify potential underlying treatable pathology. It will then focus on the evaluation and treatment of patients with persistent primary tinnitus, with recommendations to guide the evaluation and measurement of the effect of tinnitus and to determine the most appropriate interventions to improve symptoms and quality of life for tinnitus sufferers.Action StatementsThe development group made a strong recommendation that clinicians distinguish patients with bothersome tinnitus from patients with nonbothersome tinnitus. The development group made a strong recommendation against obtaining imaging studies of the head and neck in patients with tinnitus, specifically to evaluate tinnitus that does not localize to 1 ear, is nonpulsatile, and is not associated with focal neurologic abnormalities or an asymmetric hearing loss. The panel made the following recommendations: Clinicians should (a) perform a targeted history and physical examination at the initial evaluation of a patient with presumed primary tinnitus to identify conditions that if promptly identified and managed may relieve tinnitus; (b) obtain a prompt, comprehensive audiologic examination in patients with tinnitus that is unilateral, persistent ({$\geq$} 6 months), or associated with hearing difficulties; (c) distinguish patients with bothersome tinnitus of recent onset from those with persistent symptoms ({$\geq$} 6 months) to prioritize intervention and facilitate discussions about natural history and follow-up care; (d) educate patients with persistent, bothersome tinnitus about management strategies; (e) recommend a hearing aid evaluation for patients who have persistent, bothersome tinnitus associated with documented hearing loss; and (f) recommend cognitive behavioral therapy to patients with persistent, bothersome tinnitus. The panel recommended against (a) antidepressants, anticonvulsants, anxiolytics, or intratympanic medications for the routine treatment of patients with persistent, bothersome tinnitus; (b) Ginkgo biloba, melatonin, zinc, or other dietary supplements for treating patients with persistent, bothersome tinnitus; and (c) transcranial magnetic stimulation for the routine treatment of patients with persistent, bothersome tinnitus. The development group provided the following options: Clinicians may (a) obtain an initial comprehensive audiologic examination in patients who present with tinnitus (regardless of laterality, duration, or perceived hearing status); and (b) recommend sound therapy to patients with persistent, bothersome tinnitus. The development group provided no recommendation regarding the effect of acupuncture in patients with persistent, bothersome tinnitus.},

We also compared the effectiveness of retraining therapy with mixing-point masking, total masking, and with counseling alone.         Design:~         Forty-eight tinnitus patients were randomly assigned to one of three groups: counseling, counseling plus bilateral noise generators set to completely mask the tinnitus, or counseling plus bilateral noise generators with a focus on the mixing point (partial masking just below total masking). A picture-based counseling protocol was used to assist in providing similar counseling among all three groups. The Tinnitus Handicap Questionnaire was administered before and after about 12 months of treatment.         Results:~         After 12 months, in the counseling group, three of 18 patients benefited significantly, in the mixing-point group, six of 19 patients benefited, and in the total masking group, four of 11 patients benefited from the treatment. The average decrease in the questionnaire was 16.7\% for the counseling group, 31.6\% for the retraining group, and 36.4\% for the total masking group. No significant average differences among groups were observed.         Conclusions:~         One premise of retraining therapy is incorrect; a focus on mixing-point masking is not required for habituation.},

As a powerful learning tool, increasingly neural networks have been adopted by many large-scale information processing applications but there is no a set of well defined criteria for choosing a neural network. The user mostly treats a neural network as a black box and cannot explain how learning from input data was done nor how performance can be consistently ensured. We have experimented with several information visualization designs aiming to open the black box to possibly uncover underlying dependencies between the input data and the output data of a neural network. In this paper, we present our designs and show that the visualizations not only help us design more efficient neural networks, but also assist us in the process of using neural networks for problem solving such as performing a classification task.},

  abstract = {Tinnitus, the perception of sound in the absence of a physical sound in the environment, is highly heterogeneous. It varies in its etiology, characteristics, and impact on an individual's life. The sound is commonly described as "ringing," "buzzing," "crickets," "hissing," "humming." Tinnitus can be acute or chronic, mild or disabling. It can be perceived unilaterally or, more commonly, bilaterally. The sound and its location differ from person to person and fluctuate in the same individual over a certain period of time. This heterogeneity in characterization has important implications for research and clinical practice. Identifying patterns in how tinnitus sounds and its relationship to hearing may aid in identifying different forms of tinnitus and revealing their underlying mechanisms. However, the subjective nature of characterizing tinnitus makes it difficult to reliably define and measure. This chapter will focus on reviewing the psychoacoustic assessment of tinnitus, its relationship to cognitive and behavioral aspects of tinnitus, and its neuropathophysiology. In particular, it will describe the heterogeneity of tinnitus and tinnitus matching, and how individual variability in measures may be used to guide treatment and as a prognostic factor.},

Various forms of sound therapy have been developed, but there are controversies regarding the selection criteria and the efficacy of different forms of sound therapy in the clinic. Our goal was to review the types and forms of sound therapy and our understanding of how the different characteristics of tinnitus patients influence their curative effects so as to provide a reference for personalized choice of tinnitus sound therapy.Method:Using an established methodological framework, a search of six databases including PubMed identified 43 records that met our inclusion criteria. The search strategy used the following key words: tinnitus AND (acoustic OR sound OR music) AND (treatment OR therapy OR management OR intervention OR measure).Results:There are various forms of sound therapy, and most of them show positive therapeutic effects. The effect of customized sound therapy is generally better than that of non-customized sound therapy, and patients with more severe initial tinnitus respond better to sound therapy.Conclusion:Sound therapy can effectively suppress tinnitus, at least in some patients. However, there is a lack of randomized controlled trials to identify effective management strategies. Further studies are needed to identify the most effective form of sound therapy for individualized therapy, and large, multicenter, long-term follow-up studies are still needed in order to develop more effective and targeted sound-therapy protocols. In addition, it is necessary to analyze the characteristics of individual tinnitus patients and to unify the assessment criteria of tinnitus.},

In addition, the algorithm is able to adapt its prediction model to an individual's baseline data in order to improve tracking accuracy. The algorithm is evaluated on two data sets. The first is the Wyss Institute Biomarkers for Depression (WIBD) multi-modal data set, which includes audio and video speech recordings. The second data set was collected by Mundt et al (2007) and contains audio speech recordings only. The data sets are comprised of patients undergoing treatment for depression as well as control subjects. In its within-subject tracking of clinical Hamilton depression (HAM-D) ratings, the algorithm achieves root mean squared error (RMSE) of 5.49 with Spearman correlation of r = 0.63 on the WIBD data set, and achieves RMSE = 5.99 with r = 0.48 on the Mundt data set.},

However, our understanding of how these models work, especially what computations they perform at intermediate layers, has lagged behind. Progress in the field will be further accelerated by the development of better tools for visualizing and interpreting neural nets. We introduce two such tools here. The first is a tool that visualizes the activations produced on each layer of a trained convnet as it processes an image or video (e.g. a live webcam stream). We have found that looking at live activations that change in response to user input helps build valuable intuitions about how convnets work. The second tool enables visualizing features at each layer of a DNN via regularized optimization in image space. Because previous versions of this idea produced less recognizable images, here we introduce several new regularization methods that combine to produce qualitatively clearer, more interpretable visualizations. Both tools are open source and work on a pre-trained convnet with minimal setup.},

The conventional signal recovery approaches for this problem are mainly developed based on the assumption that an exact knowledge of the sensing matrix is available. In this work, however, we present a novel data-driven and model-based methodology that achieves blind recovery; i.e., signal recovery without requiring the knowledge of the sensing matrix. To this end, we make use of the deep unfolding technique and develop a model-driven deep neural architecture which is designed for this specific task. The proposed deep architecture is able to learn an alternative sensing matrix by taking advantage of the underlying unfolded algorithm such that the resulting learned recovery algorithm can accurately and quickly (in terms of the number of iterations) recover the underlying compressed signal of interest from its one-bit noisy measurements. In addition, due to the incorporation of the domain knowledge and the mathematical model of the system into the proposed deep architecture, the resulting network benefits from enhanced interpretability, has a very small number of trainable parameters, and requires very small number of training samples, as compared to the commonly used black-box deep neural network alternatives for the problem at hand.},

  abstract = {Energy consumption is an important issue in continuous wireless telemonitoring of physiological signals. Compressed sensing (CS) is a promising framework to address it, due to its energy-efficient data compression procedure. However, most CS algorithms have difficulty in data recovery due to nonsparsity characteristic of many physiological signals. Block sparse Bayesian learning (BSBL) is an effective approach to recover such signals with satisfactory recovery quality. However, it is time-consuming in recovering multichannel signals, since its computational load almost linearly increases with the number of channels. This work proposes a spatiotemporal sparse Bayesian learning algorithm to recover multichannel signals simultaneously. It not only exploits temporal correlation within each channel signal, but also exploits inter-channel correlation among different channel signals. Furthermore, its computational load is not significantly affected by the number of channels. The proposed algorithm was applied to brain computer interface (BCI) and EEG-based driver's drowsiness estimation. Results showed that the algorithm had both better recovery performance and much higher speed than BSBL. Particularly, the proposed algorithm ensured that the BCI classification and the drowsiness estimation had little degradation even when data were compressed by 80\%, making it very suitable for continuous wireless telemonitoring of multichannel signals.},

  abstract = {This work is concerned with identification of Wiener systems whose outputs are measured by binary-valued sensors. The system consists of a linear FIR (finite impulse response) subsystem of known order, followed by a nonlinear function with a known parametrization structure. The parameters of both linear and nonlinear parts are unknown. Input design, identification algorithms, and their essential properties are presented under the assumptions that the distribution function of the noise is known and the nonlinearity is continuous and invertible. It is shown that under scaled periodic inputs, identification of Wiener systems can be decomposed into a finite number of core identification problems. The concept of joint identifiability of the core problem is introduced to capture the essential conditions under which the Wiener system can be identified with binary-valued observations. Under scaled full-rank conditions and joint identifiability, a strongly convergent algorithm is constructed. The algorithm is shown to be asymptotically efficient for the core identification problem, hence achieving asymptotic optimality in its convergence rate. For computational simplicity, recursive algorithms are also developed.},

  abstract = {The existing ways to encrypt images based on compressive sensing usually treat the whole measurement matrix as the key, which renders the key too large to distribute and memorize or store. To solve this problem, a new image compression\textendash encryption hybrid algorithm is proposed to realize compression and encryption simultaneously, where the key is easily distributed, stored or memorized. The input image is divided into 4 blocks to compress and encrypt, then the pixels of the two adjacent blocks are exchanged randomly by random matrices. The measurement matrices in compressive sensing are constructed by utilizing the circulant matrices and controlling the original row vectors of the circulant matrices with logistic map. And the random matrices used in random pixel exchanging are bound with the measurement matrices. Simulation results verify the effectiveness, security of the proposed algorithm and the acceptable compression performance.},

  abstract = {Classical regression methods treat covariates as a vector and estimate a corresponding vector of regression coefficients. Modern applications in medical imaging generate covariates of more complex form such as multidimensional arrays (tensors). Traditional statistical and computational methods are proving insufficient for analysis of these high-throughput data due to their ultrahigh dimensionality as well as complex structure. In this article, we propose a new family of tensor regression models that efficiently exploit the special structure of tensor covariates. Under this framework, ultrahigh dimensionality is reduced to a manageable level, resulting in efficient estimation and prediction. A fast and highly scalable estimation algorithm is proposed for maximum likelihood estimation and its associated asymptotic properties are studied. Effectiveness of the new methods is demonstrated on both synthetic and real MRI imaging data.},

We give two methods for (approximately) solving this problem, each based on minimizing a differentiable convex function plus an l 1 regularization term. Using a first order method developed by Hale et al, we demonstrate the performance of the methods through numerical simulation. We find that, using these methods, compressed sensing can be carried out even when the quantization is very coarse, e.g., 1 or 2 bits per measurement.},
