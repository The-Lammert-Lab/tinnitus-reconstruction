This document includes instructions for running the tinnitus-project standalone on macOS and Windows.

1. Download and save the "tinnitus_projectstandaloneApplication" folder to your computer. 
2. Download and save the provided configuration file to your computer. Be sure to check the "data_dir" field (see subject_instructions.txt).

3. Go to https://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html and download the MATLAB Runtime R2022b (9.13) application for your operating system.

4. Install MATLAB runtime following the instructions at https://www.mathworks.com/help/compiler_sdk/ml_code/install-the-matlab-runtime.html

NOTE: On macOS, you may need to set the Path explicitly. The following instructions can be seen here: https://www.mathworks.com/help/compiler_sdk/ml_code/mcr-path-settings-for-run-time-deployment.html

Open terminal and run:

echo $DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH

This displays the current path, which will be empty if this step needs to be completed. 
Then, copy and paste the following lines into the terminal and hit enter.

export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH="${DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH:+${DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH}:}\
<MATLAB_RUNTIME_INSTALL_DIR>/runtime/maci64:\
<MATLAB_RUNTIME_INSTALL_DIR>/bin/maci64:\
<MATLAB_RUNTIME_INSTALL_DIR>/sys/os/maci64:\
<MATLAB_RUNTIME_INSTALL_DIR>/extern/bin/maci64"

You can run 

echo $DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH

again to confirm the path has been saved correctly.

5a. To run the experiment on macOS, call the run_tinnitus_project.sh script via the terminal with the MATLAB Runtime location as an argument. To find the path to the "run_tinnitus_project.sh" script, you can drag the file into the terminal after typing "sh ". This will look like:

sh path/to/run_tinnitus_project.sh /Applications/MATLAB/MATLAB_Runtime/R2022b

5b. To run the experiment on Windows, simply double click on the "tinnitus_project.exe" file. The experiment should start automatically.
