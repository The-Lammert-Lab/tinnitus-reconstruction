\section{Project Summary}
\subsection{Overview} 
Each proposal must contain a summary of the proposed project not more than {\bf one page in length}. The Project
Summary consists of an overview, a statement on the intellectual merit of the proposed activity, and a statement
on the broader impacts of the proposed activity.
The overview includes a description of the activity that would result if the proposal were funded and a statement
of objectives and methods to be employed.  

The Project Summary should be written in the third person, informative to other persons working in
the same or related fields, and, insofar as possible, understandable to a scientifically or technically 
literate lay reader. It should not be an abstract of the proposal.

If the Project Summary contains special characters it may be uploaded as a Supplementary Document.
{\bf Project Summaries submitted as a PDF must be formatted with separate headings for the overview, statement on the
intellectual merit of the proposed activity, and statement on the broader impacts of the proposed activity}. Failure
to include these headings may result in the proposal being returned without review.
Additional instructions for preparation of the Project Summary are available in FastLane.\\
\subsection{Intellectual Merit} 
The statement on intellectual merit should describe the potential of the proposed activity to advance knowledge.
\subsection{Broader Impacts of the Proposed Work} 
The statement on broader impacts should describe the potential of the proposed activity to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes.
