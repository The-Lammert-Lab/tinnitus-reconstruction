Thank you for agreeing to participate in this research! 

Below is a brief set of instructions to guide you to through the experiment. 

Before starting, please fill in the "data_dir" field of the provided configuration file with an appropriate location to save your data. 
For example, for macOS, this line may read:
data_dir: /Users/USERNAME/Desktop/Tinnitus-Data
Where USERNAME is the username of the current login.

After initiating the experiment, you will be asked to select a config file. Navigate to one of the provided files and select it. 
You will then be presented with a start screen with instructions to press the "f" key when ready to begin. 
Once begun, the program will play a target sound followed by a noisy stimulus sound. 
A fraction of the stimuli will have the target embedded inside. 
Press "f" if you do NOT believe the stimuli was embedded and press "j" if you do.

You are free to pause or stop the experiment at any time to take as long of a break as desired.
You are not required to complete the experiment in one sitting.
The program will automatically pause after you have completed 100 trials and wait for the "f" key to be pressed to begin again.

Upon completion of 200 trials, the experiment will conclude.
